Incidentally it makes the phone look great - a little like the blue accents on the new Nokia Lumia 800.- Battery Life: longer than the Focus.,2
I had a previous vizio smart tv that didn't work either but someone stole it.,1
"Hopefully, 3D TIVO and cable boxes will come soon, as well as more movies besides just Monsters vs. Aliens.",1
If you want a wireless network camera that you can login to over the network (local network or internet) to see what is going on with you pet or home etc this is a great buy.,2
"As a result, I called LG again showing them that I am really frustrated buy they Don't Care, they said you have to wait again.",0
Some people might say that you can find a cheaper deal on the HTC website or on google but neither of those worked with my credit card for some reason.,1
The support was really phenomenal.,2
The Kindle 8.9 was so easy to use.,2
Also the phone comes with the side power button programmed to drop cellphone calls.,1
It's not perfect -- no camera is -- but for our needs and preferred style of use we felt it was the best compromise out of the current crop of cameras.,0
"I hope when I need another laptop, this model is still available!",2
it serves me well but itried to connect it to wireless receiver offered by ATT how ever it didnot work well but i enjoy the picture reception with the streaming services,2
The only not so good part (which I also read about on dpreview.com and agree with) is ISO 1600 produces some slightly grainy photos.,0
"Replaced the motherboard, , not work.",0
You can also view calendar dates and emails.,1
"But Overall it was good buy, and Im happy with it.",2
"I LOVE this little camera, and its ability to shoot high quality photos -- I took it everywhere with me, and now it lies ingloriously inside a plastic baggie, waiting for the day when I can get it reapaired.",2
"However, after reconnecting the wired LAN from the modem directly, it was superb.",2
I bought this camera in future shop downtown Toronto last year December.,1
"After being a ""Premier"" customer of 15 years, and my bank account literally being ""raped"" every month with a payment that amounted to a car payment, I BROKE my contract, ported my # to this Tracfone & so far, it is, by far, the BEST investment I've made!!!",2
"I have taken early dawn, early twilight, late night, portrait, nature, time exposures, double exposures, and sports photos in that time.",1
The sound quality is good and it is easy to use.,2
Still works.,1
I Love it!,2
On the internet I found there was little information comparing these two cameras and those that did all recommended the D40 over the D70 because of the larger screen and better jpeg quality straight out of camera.,2
"Well it's hit and miss for this fellow!With all that said, I do like many of the features of the tv.",2
There were several things that set this camera apart from others:1.,2
I was looking for my first quality HDTV with a budget of under $1300.,1
"I settled on this camera because of the balance of price, card slots (the D4 has a weird card slot) and megapixels.In the old days, we would go for the most, but the D800 has so many megapixels the files become unwieldy.",2
Everything I do with it seems to take longer than it should.,0
"A $100 phone on an $80 dollar per month plan is going to end up costing more than $2,000 over the lifetime of the two-year commitment.",1
"Not a panic, since he was a long way away, but I then took the shot (zoomed in and out) to show how far away their awareness runs.",1
"At any rate, dealing with Amazon was great and the delivery service (Pilot Freight I think it was) was very professional.",2
"I thought that was great, cause I've had problems ordering things online before.",2
This has no effect on videos but it does bother the battery life.The battery life itself was really bad until I turned the brightness all the way down.,0
when you get a show in high def you might as well be there instead of watching the show.,1
The only true thing about the title is that its a ceramic white phone.,1
I kept it in my swim trunk pocket and had no problem with it.,1
THE ITEM ARRIVED ON TIME HOW EVER THIS PRODUCT IS A CHEAP RUSSIAN TABLET AND IS NOT AN OFFICIAL GOOGLE TABLET,1
It's a mistake microsoft made.,0
I frequently end the day with 1/3 battery charge remaining (with the focus it would be drained).- micro-USB port is on the bottom now!,2
Very cool camera which makes perfect pictures.,2
"Each time I call, the same conversation occurs.",0
"I'm sure it was knocked around a little bit in this travel kit, but I expect a camera I originally paid over $350 to be reasonably rugged.",0
Allshare doesn't play RMVB vedio.6.,1
"The Nokia 6350 itself is fine, but I needed an unlocked phone  This phone from this supplier was not unlocked.",0
All buttons are frozen.While researching this camera I did not see any issues about this.,0
She even tried to have us go to Western Union to send money to Paris.,0
This was just a pain to switch back and forth from TV mode to AUX mode when needing to adjust or mute the TV...,0
"Very frustrating, particularly because other wireless devices work fine in that room.",0
The Dynamic contrast ratio is the HDTV's ability to produce dark blacks.,1
"Very crisp, and excellent for Blu-ray movies.",2
"Regular calls are fine so far.Battery works fine and stays all day during playing games, calling, messaging, internet browsing and using camera.",1
The package contained the WRONG DVR.,0
Easy to use.,2
I needed 6 TV's for stations in an educational workshop.,1
What it came with is a grossly undersized internal memory.,1
"I got the headphones,and no response was given.it should not be because I paid fullsi quiere comuniquence con migo",
We still need to be more familiar with the operation.,1
"And since Aquos is the high end line of their electronics, shouldn't ALL their televisions have the Aquos Link?Anyway, the television is great.",2
"better quality,well made,slimmer than his brother Samsung M575,excelent for having any of the paylo plans.my sister has one of this and she love it,she text a lot and uses the slider keyboard and says the keyboard is a little cramped but she can works with that.the battery life is not that great, and this is my main concern but  for me that only use the cell por casual calls is not a real problem,but if u are a big texter,web user or caller u most charge the phone daily for sure.anyway... for the price and service this is a good cell to have with the paylo virgin mobile service.",2
The G6's body is somewhat more chunky.Panasonic GH3:  The GH3 apparently shares the same sensor as the OMD-EM5 above and so also produces still images that are very close in quality to those of the NEX-6.,1
I will always love the macro on this camera.,2
Amazing picture and great wireless connectivity with all my different devices!,2
"I am a Mac girl myself, so I found it a little bewildering and difficult to use.",0
"What's confusing, is that there are DTV channels and TV channels (those are snowy - as in an old analog tv?).",0
It works just as good as any mid-range android device.,2
All cable boxes currently in existance have HDMI 1.3.,1
So far this has proved to be an excellent TV.,2
I expect to get another year out of it despite the amount of times I have dropped the phone.,1
"My son and I bought one for each of us.......had one before lasted 6 years with no problems ever, dropped it plenty of times, in the water too!",2
"Sure enough, if you opt for zooming during movies, it will far exceed any other sound that the camera will pick up.",2
Expanded compensation9.,
So I just do the settings manually and it works out great.,2
This is my first big screen TV and I've only ever seen 3D in the theaters so my opinion is not based on a ton of experience.,2
It is too fragile.,0
It is small and easy to take along anywhere.,2
I tried this television at a Bose theater.,1
It has produced stellar photos at every occasion and as you can tell by the different number of events I've been to the versatility of the camera is extremely impressive.,2
"Having spent the last 40 years doing photography, I am not much in favor of point and shoot cameras, digital or film-based.",1
I was able to get head and shoulder shots of a cheetah over 500 feet away.,2
I was hesitant to go with an off brand but this purchase has proven to be a good one.,2
The only thing that doesnt work perfectly is when you zoom sometimes the picture wont be crystal clear (but most of the time it works- and I've had this camera for awhile!!!,2
I just returned from a vacation during which I took pictures with my old Sony DSC505F 2.1 megapixel cybershot and with the Dimage 7.,1
The camera started out great.,2
"Perhaps because there needs to be a waterproof membrane protecting the microphone, the sound is horrible.",0
You might also want a special cover for shooting in inclement weather that lets you control the camera and keeps the water off it.Digital wallet?,1
This phone is absolutely terrible.,0
The ones in the store are PRICEY to say the least.,
"Just a slight downfall, but I wanted a larger screen.The keyboard does take a little bit getting used to.",0
We do plan on moving to someplace bigger and will hopefully be able to deal with this issue better down the road.- Picture settings.,1
"We had a 6 year old JVC LCD 42"" with an ipod dock before this one, and while it also had flashlighting issues, it looked great right out of the box, we didn't have to spend weeks setting it up, had perfect side viewing angles, the ipod dock worked great, and hadn't had any issues with it since we bought it.",2
The timer is hard to figure out.,0
"In their guts have the same processor dual-core Snapdragon S4 of ATIV S and 1GB of RAM, although in this case with less battery of three in competition.",0
"Also durable...my husband let my 6 year old take a picture (came out great, by the way!)",2
I brought them into work the next day to show people and EVERYBODY kept asking me what was the model and make of my camera.The images are crisp and clean.,2
thank you sceptre.,2
I wanted a basic no-frills TV when my old CRT died.,1
"So I called Amazon this time, the rep assured me this time they would see to it that my number is given to them.",0
"Things like the ""motion remover"", ""multi-motion capture"" and ""motion panorama"" are finicky at best, rarely used and rarely deliver usable photos.I have been a longtime fan of Fuji's upper tier bridge cameras.",2
"They do not yet have a driver available for Win 8... however, you can get one from CameraKaze that functions with Win 8.",1
this is the first hdtv i've purchased and i'm pleasantly surprised.,2
Will continue to work with it too see if it improves.,1
"Initially, and for some time afterwards, we were both thrilled with the purchase.",2
But now after two months of use it reports no service and even popping the SIM card in and out again does not resolve it.,0
That is what has basically dragged it down to the 3-4 star range.,0
And...that's it.,
It would also be nice if it would save video clips to a local drive but in fact I see no way to save video at all which is a disappointment.,0
First I really like the set and it is a great bargain!Couple of things I have noticed.1) They advertise the bezzel being super slim which it is but they did compensate for that by making the screen portion not extend all the way out to the bezel.,2
"Also, this camera goes through batteries unbelievably quickly.",2
I got down low enough to get a couple shots but it never touched the sand.,1
It was a great gift for my mother she's not every in to technology so she loved this phone.,2
"I have had a lot of experience with Sony Cybershots, but the new economy has caught up with me.",2
The processor works perfectly and as mentioned before there is pretty much no lag in switching between programs.,2
I bought a Zvox audio box and it works great with this set.,2
"Comes with an IR remote line to stick in front of your cable box, so your TV remote can control your Dish or Direct TV box - this simply did not work for me.",0
"The LCD screen is bright, and high quality.. but its smaller.. and the menu system seems cluttered and annoyingly thought out.",1
"I ended up getting my TV a on Wed, Aug 22nd, a week later than I should have.The TV is as good as all the review claims, so I enjoyed it greatly during last week, I hooked it up with an antenna and were amazed at the picture quality.",2
Why can't somebody build a camera with a reliable built-in PIR?,0
I only got it for the Camera though!!!,1
"I flip the screen out more than I thought I would, up to now it's still solid as a rock.",1
"sure next year they will cost less and a better model will come out,but keep holing out and you never enjoy 3D At home.Over all this Tv is awesome.",2
I have been very pleased and feel that the money was well spent.I was a little surprised that this camera still comes with the 16 MG card - definitely upgrade to the 512 or 1 GB card.,2
I found LG to be leading the way in new technology.,2
Amazon was fantastic about the exchange and delivered the new one inside of a week via CEVA and the delivery men assisted in the removal of the old tv off the wall and installation of the new tv.At first i regretted my purchase.,2
It is a crop sensor camera which means the lens length is longer.,1
I must say that I was overwhelmed by all of the cameras on the market and selecting one to buy.,2
"However, it is neither very wide for some indoors and architectural shots, nor fast enough for many flash-free low-light situations.",1
"Their price...and then Vizio itself started to realize something, they could make quality TV's at a low price and that's exactly what they did.",2
They are sufficient for providing the Nokia's superior FM reception and they sound better than the Nokia buds.When my cell phone contract comes up in a couple of months I will take a free phone if I can get the little Samsung ruggedized waterproof phone for when I'm camping or fishing.,2
The main thing I care about is the app view and that works well.,2
The PC version is a little more difficult to configure the audio side of things as that relies upon some third party (free plugin) for that to function.,0
"I have owned/tried a few of the newer compacts, but they don't compare to the low light/high ISO capabilities (w/o flash) of this camera!",1
"Absolutely fantastic quality all around.Unfortunately, I just can't get on board with Windows Phone (or any Windows really).",2
I have had the TV for a little over a month now and I am very happy with it.,2
"After getting a new power cord, our other power cord went out as well!",2
Remember when television channels would stop at night and all you would hear was static and see the static on the screen?,0
!,
During the second panel replacement a helpful tech had the television apart during a repair and informed me the issues I was having was unacceptable and the wiring/connectors they used were the flimsiest and cheapest he had seen.,0
I could not be happier with the Canon Powershot A620.,2
"So far, not bad.",2
"This was absolutely fantastic camera - the sliding door cover was extremely useful and rugged, user menues were very intuitive and responsive, the focus rocker was very precise.",2
It works better but still not perfectly.,1
work perfectly.,2
It would not get me through the day.,0
Maybe I am doing something wrong??,0
"I needed help from a vizio technician, which only took a few minutes, and it was up and running.",1
I really think I will hang it on a flower hangar or something out in my yard.DON'T BUY CASIO PRODUCTS!!!,0
details in pictures are awesome.,2
"Definitely a great camera for stationary tripod type use, a little less so for use on the spur of the moment until I get the multi-photo option figured out.",2
"You cannot see it when watching anything, so I decided it was not worth the hassle of sending back, along with the option of having no other tv available for this spot.Picture is good.",0
"I'll preface my review by saying I give this 5 stars for its value and not raw performance.I have always been a fan of Panasonic TV's, prior to purchasing the TC-L50EM5 I had owned two Panasonic Plasmas.",2
I could do my research and cancel the order if necessary.,
"When I first turned the set on, it was confirmed - the SOUND actually WAS LOUSY.",0
"Second, my email account sometimes has a problem updating.",0
Please save your money and get an i-pad or dell has a great new laptop that doubles as a tablet.,2
"At least my phone still seems to work and most of these wild animals can't seem to climb trees, except those",
I would of never thought it would give my vidoe camera a run for the money but that is exactly what it has done.I am really enjoying this camera and all its super easy functions that it offers.,2
I  agree that the remote is poor at best.,0
"I feel compelled to do so for this product, in an attempt to warn people of the poor quality.I agree totally with Dustin's review, as I experienced the same result.While the external product is beautiful to look at, the picture quality is horrible.",2
"If you didn't have a bad lens, you probably loved that camera.",1
"And when the General leaps a bridge in Hazard county, it seems like it's about to land in your lap.The only thing I don't like watchin' on this TV is diaper commercials and seeing a 4' baby ass settin' down on a wet spot.",1
"And with the Samsung name, you know that you're getting an excellent product.",2
"This is my review of the product that I own, how I feel about what I bought, and how THIS product has performed for ME!",2
I did after a few days of playing with it.,1
It will be interesting to see how photos appear in a vanilla S5 which Google will release.S-HEALTH:I rely and use S-Health more than any other app in my Galaxy S5.,1
I just purchased another charger.,1
I searched canon user forums and some people reported that the new XTi is slightly different than the original in terms of color and light adjustments.,1
"Since the HS10 does not support TTL, metering is manual.",1
"The 3D feature is crazy to watch, it looks like stuff is in the room with you and it feels like you are on the field when watching sports in 3D.",1

She uses hers for educational apps for our grandchildren.,1
I have since dropped the carrier and use prepaid phones now.,1
Very amazing focused shots.,2
Objects have to be within 5 feet to see any details.,1
"It's usually always the same story, at least for Nokia devices.The hardware is excellent.",2
"True story.Had just purchase almost a beautiful ProBook,by MAC,we know APPLE is expensive,but so lovely and work well as i had use one or two years ago,but always oddly come back to HP~ and or ASUS,but was just about to order again purchase a APPLE last night.Then i see on the staples site this beautie,and at mi local NY NJ tri-state area STAPLES.Hence.BUY IT.",2
"Contacted Samsung and they thought something was wrong with the set.I liked the built in wifi ,the TV had very good sound from the stock speakers and the USB media player, it like having a 32""digital photo frame.",2
"the issue was resolved, but selfishly not when i wanted it to be.",1
I have no regrets.,2
Saved me the hassle but really?,0
I travel a lot for work and preferred Thinkpads because of their rock solid performance.,2
"I should have just bought the iPad, even the older version of the iPad would be better than this new HDX.",0
"outdoors or good indoor lighting) are very, very good.",2
Definitely a great purchase.,2
"For instance, I always reformat the memory card after downloading the photos (the card manufacturers recommend a 'format' rather than 'deleting' the files, as a reformat recreates the file system on the card and helps prevent corrupted data) but 'format' isn't a function that can be assigned/accessed via the methods listed above.",1
"Everyone that has used it has been very pleased or downright excited, my mother went out and bought one the next day.",2
And this was not the first or second time this has happened with Amazon Warehouse Deals.,0
the angles and view do not work.,0
"That plastic toggle switch on the back, which controls the zoom, flash and programming functions is the Fuji A340's Achille's heel.",1
Especially trying to do a search on youtube.,1
"Another ""stand out"" feature is the sub-woofer and great speakers...what a super sound out of a 29 inch frame!!!",1
Why isn't there a user account option where i can view my youtube subscriptions or favorite videos?,0
Not sure whether it's major but safer side I requested for replacement.,0
I got some awesome shots.,2
its a good phone.,2
"Needless to say, the tv was accepted for return and larger point is BUYER BEWARE with AMAZON WAREHOUSE ""so called"" Deals as the waste of time waiting for a busted up tv... was no deal!!!",0
Since tracfone came out with the Valet I combined them into one.,1
"You're basically playing the panel lottery any time you purchase a LARGE LED tv set, period.",1
Maybe you get lucky and get a set that does not have this problem.,1
"Anyway, if you upgrade to the 1 GB card, you can take lots of practice shots.",1
But there's nothing to complain about really.,2
"The lens is very good, and the features are easy to use.",2
Slave children part?,
"Suggest you look at it in person first, but we love it.Anyway, do your homework, but I feel great about this purchase.",2
It weight is also around 300gm.,1
"Even when you would use the remote's MENU button to bring up NET TV, there was no response once NET TV was chosen.",0
The wife just loves it!,2
Blank boxes appear on the home screen without their image for various app icons.,0
"Before I bought the kingle fire I thought all tablet were basically the same and I actually thought the kindle fire hd would be nothing special with it being $199, but I was wrong.It has an amazing hd screen and amazing speakers.",2
This camera did get soaked down at the cooler party called water wars.,1
Color is awesome and night viewing is surprisingly clear..,2
Camera and hardware is as seen on the website.,1
"The still shot resolutions aren't the best, but the fact you can take it into the water makes it worth the money and less quality in picture.",1
"Pros - high quality materials, well refined details (e.g.",2
By the way that was on Dec 12 and it's Jan 2 and still no TV.,0
"Never buy a ""dumb"" TV again.",0
Either the camera lens wont open or it wont close.,0
"The shutter release remote, flash, telephoto and macro lenses, screen protectors, UV filters, memory card wallet, lenses, and the camera itself have so far exceeded my expectations.The only thing I would recommend to the sellers is that instead of including 2 UV filters, add an extra $5-10 to the bundle and send the Vivitar 58mm lens filter kit with UV, Polarizer, and Fluorescent filters.",1
Easy download features.,2
I will point out it is a technical marvel and not for those intimidated by it.,2
A great product.,2
Even know the mounts all seem secure and strong I like to have my camera tethered just incase they fail in some way.,2
Memory is stable (this is application dependent).,1
forget about catching a great spontaneous moment.,0
"When we tried to take a pic the screen showed black with purple stripes across the display.I purchased a Sony at a local Best Buy, and all is well.However, Amazon has been wonderful!",1
"Purchased this to replace an older ""dumb"" TV that had failed.",0
"?Based on my reading of numerous reviews here and elsewhere, and previously noting the excessive warmth of the defective unit on my MBP, I believe the 60W L-connector supply is either a) defective in materials and/or design, or b) severely underpowered for the application.",0
"the voices are crisp and good, and cingular is the best becasue they have the only chat thing.",2
"After converting all my VHS tapes and DVD disc, i bought my first Apple TV and stored everything on the ICloud.",1
Does have good sound and HD quality.,2
That didn't work so he told me as soon as they receive it they will fix it and ship it back out within 24 hours.,1
"Poor RCA plugs plus one that got center pin broken quickly, is why I took off 2 stars.",0
"I'm relatively experienced so I used the tapping method, but that won't work in every house.",0
I'd also like to find a flatter lens so there is less fisheye distortion.,2
worth the expense.,2
"If they are going to obsess over thinness to the point of making the power supply external, it needs to have a cord on it instead of being one of these obnoxious gigantic brick plugs.With such a great picture, it's too bad they had to spoil it by completely dropping the ball in other ways.",0
I got lucky and the unit worked fine after that.Getting the unit online was a hassle.,2
"Sharp has always been known to display great reds(one reason we bought our first Sharp); however, most LED HDTVs make up the picture with red, green, and blue (ie, making up the primary color yellow without a true yellow pixel), but this HDTV has the quattron technology that allows it to display a perfect yellow, and if you look real close, you can see the pixels are made up of red, green, blue, and yellow (4 colors instead of the typical 3).8) Black is also difficult for all TVs because black is the absence of light, and TVs are trying to create a picture using light.",2
The item arrived quickly and undamaged.,2
I wanted the ease and portability of a point and shoot but wanted the features and photo quality of a larger camera.,2
"The product arrived quickly,  as stated.",2
It was so handy!,2
My daughter loves it!,2
It was running at some weird lower resolution so the screen is not full on TV.,0
"It wasn't the easiest to install, the screws were kind of hard to screw in and after everything was up, the tv wobbles real easy on the stand.",0
It was not compatible with the cell that I got.,1
This has got to be the easiest to use digital camera I have ever used.,2
I bought this camera to replace a far more expensive Panasonic outdoor security camera.,1
"Everything works perfectly, Blue-tooth on my car, wifi, mp3 player,(I'm using power amp app which is fantastic)for videos I added the MX player app which is a must to play HD videos, speaking of HD videos/pictures the camera has a flash and takes perfect pictures and the camcorder can take 1280x 720 videos!",2
").As for movie mode (which I plan to use just as much as the photo capabilities), it works fairly well.",2
This means that you must use the so-so speakers when you use the antenna or an HDMI source that doesn't have an analog audio output (including perhaps some digital cable boxes).,2
The customer support representative was awesome.,2
"It's not a terrible camera, but it has fallen considerably short of my expectations.",0
I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a tablet and you can't beat the price.,2
This phone is excellent.,2
"?I always use the screen, it makes it easy to frame the picture.",1
"(If you say ""Hulu"" it takes you to a website called Lulu.",0
"Contrary to what your parents told you about your eyes growing up, this is not health related, but rather so the MPG distortion blends at a greater distance and you don't notice it.",1
I happened to have very important things running on it that would have required program upgrades to move to a new computer with my backup files.,1
"The directions for setting up the IR blaster in the included paper owner's manual, as well as on the TV screen, were very simple to follow.",2
I gave this as a gift to a friend and he loved it and uses it continually.,2
I haven't have the phone for 2 months.,0
"I researched a number of monitored alarm systems (ADT, Vivint among them) and decided on SimpliSafe.",1
"For a very inexpensive camera, this is working great for me for keeping an eye on my vacation home.",2
Hopefully Canon will take note.,1
"Sound is oftentimes painful since it has only one mic and no wind cancellation, and the picture is usually completely grainy- In even somewhat dim lighting, pics turn out grainy, blurred, or bothI'm most disappointed with the video capture, it's almost entirely unusable due to both the abhorrent quality and the amount of space it uses (Motion-JPEG as a codec belongs in the 20th century), but the majority of my pictures give satisfy my quality standards.",1
"I am glad I got this one, however.",2
Until Kodak discontinued support!,
"Unfortunately, Hulu is the only place where the soaps are shown, except for iTunes, which looks like a much more expensive endeavor.",1
They also provide  2 x 2500 mAH batteries and a charger with camera.,2
We have the full manual and we've even called TracFone and there is no way to avoid annoying text messages or phone calls from people I don't want to hear from.,0
"I knew it was a deal for $50 but it WAS advertised as NEW IN BOX, it was battered and obviously VERY USED but yes, in box (also very used).",0
Manual is PDF and can be downloaded.6.,1
It has crazy engine to play 1080p movies with no hassle.Cons:- The remote is not really that responsive.,1
It's unnecessary for local/ single player play.,1

NO SOFTWARE REQUIRED!!,1

"Since I bought it from one of Amazon's partners instead of Amazon directly, I cannot return or exchange it, so I'm stuck.",0
"I've never ordered a item quite this pricey online, so I was somewhat hesitant.",1
"Password, enter, then MENU BUTTON to go to the next item?",1
It was suggested along with other accessories to be purchased with the camera.,1
"I thought it was due to the heat and humidity, but the same happened under water and it was not because it leaked.",0
"Also I would recommend people avoid this delivery service, especially for large purchases.",0
"Took 400 ish pictures, many in a hurry sitting at roadside on the bike.",1
Without downloading the camera is useless and so I returned it.,0
The main image for this TV DOES NOT SHOW THIS and gives you the impression that there's no border except for the clear acrylic frame.,0
"It costs me an extra $10/month and I no longer get unlimited data, but I believe it's worth it.",
"No OS, Not pre-imaged.",0
"You can, of course, hook up a speaker system, and there is a headphone jack in the back of the TV.",1
"I've been sorely disappointed with this TV since I bought it, and Sony has lost a customer for life.",0
"So far these minor anoyances I can live with, I mean I did for last three years.The biggest problem however, is with the lens distortion.",0
For now the XPro1 is my go to camera for my style of shooting in this form factor.,1
"But it is realy heavy (heavier than anything I had before), but well worth it.",2
"One review mentioned the sound, actually it is the best built in TV sound I have heard.",2
I'm a very satisfied customer.,2
I've emailed D-Link tech support several times and they do not respond.,0
Now when we leave we set the alarm and have peace of mind.,1
"I recommend the surface to anyone, for use at home or while traveling.",2
This makes me quite relaxing.,2
Even toy digital cameras render higher quality.Very disappointed.,0
You couldn't tell this phone from new!,0
I think the old Tube tv's last way longer we had them for 20 yrs & never had a problem with the Tube Ones .,2
The D610/lens combo has allowed me to take very sharp pictures of my youngest at full speed during one of his recent soccer game.,2
"It can do smartphone things.After about a month it starts freezing and locking up and randomly restarting, but that has been my experience with all android phones.Personally I was tired of buying a new android phone literally every 3 months, so I finally got an iPhone 4s and absolutely love it.",2
Shame on HTC for charging to fix a problem they caused.,0
I have recently met a person who invested all his money in buying a T5i and a backup T4i both brand new with some basic lenses.,1
Will only be sad if it gets cheaper for black friday.,1
It fits comfortably in my hand and the processor is incredibly fast so there is no lag.,2
"One important thing--check with Tracfone to make sure that there is service in your area before buying, our town didn't have service but we were able to get a phone number in the town beside us.",1
"Reds become a faded red, etc.",1

"Pushing the channel button again should obviously take you to the digital one, since the analog channel would be, for example 13, and the digital one would be 13-1.",1
"Netflix, Amazon TV, iTunes and DVD's look great.",2
The Sound Volume Could Use Some work.,1
The thing that I love the most about this camera is the super awesome wide angle of view.,2
"Samsung seems to have it down, I would say that you would need to spend a LOT more money to get any real improvement in picture.",0
"The sound is merely OK. Expected that, so I connected a digital optical cable from the TV to my Denon receiver; problem solved.Setup was trivial.",1
"Most TVs that appear to have a light, washed out picture, is because the dynamic contrast ratio is very low.9) The motion is non-blur at 240Hz, but then again, I watch NFL football and tennis, and I really didn't notice much difference from our 60Hz HDTV from 2005.10) There is a really neat wallpaper mode that can display your own pictures or have really nice stock art pictures that can display one or rotate through.",1
Mounted well.,2
Amazing graphics.,2
Hope Olympus pull their act together and brings a camera worthy of its D-460 heritage.,1
I am thrilled with this original purpose and am thinking of many more ways to use this handy little system.,2
For the price it should have locking mechanism in both sides of the shoe cord.,1
"Can't beat that.-The actual 3d works very well, i ran 3d demos off from youtube (not using the smart tv app but downloaded 1080p 3d demo mp4s and have it played on my ps3) boy was i impressed.",2
"I'm not really a video geek and usually don't notice things like this, but it does bother me at times.",0
"It is a 7"" versus a 10"" pad.",1
Here's a summary of my impressions.Pros:-the TV is very light and thin and the picture quality is excellent-TV can play files from an external hard drive or from a USB flash drive.,2
"I love the point an shoot cameras made by Sony mainly because of the Professional Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens, that makes a huge difference when you compare this camera to a similar price camera from another manufacturer, in my opinion the picture quality of this camera is far superior then HP, Canon, Olympus, or Nikon.Sony include the new ultra fast BIONZ processor in all their new cameras, this is a big deal when you take high resolution pictures and want your camera to be ready to shoot the next in no time at all.There's a lot of things I love about this camera like: the animated graphical menus, cool metal exterior finish, big display, slide show with or without music, extended battery life, high sensitivity of ISO 3200, Super SteadyShot, and Convenient Photo Modes among others.The Smile Shutter Mode does work but its a bit tricky when you try to use it on several subjects since you have to detect everyone faces for the Smile Shutter to work properly and this is not as easy as it sounds.Overall I recommend this camera to everyone who likes a small size point an shoot, easy to use, that can take great quality pictures without spending too much money.",2
I purchased mine with the sole intent on conducting business (Real Estate) and having the portability to place it in my briefcase without breaking my shoulder!,1
I always shake too much to get good shots but the image stabilization seems to work very well at full zoom.We also used this camera for the family pictures during Christmas and the timer function is pretty cool.,2
But I got a T-Mobile Galaxy S2 and its not even a new one.,1
"Prior to the upgrade, Hulu Plus was working fine as was the web browser.",0
"Upon turning it on, we saw that it was completely broken.",0
Easy to use and comes with numerous capabilities.,2
"Good job, Olympus!",2
I can't wait to use it on the snow.,1
this is absolutely the best laptop that I used since my last acers.,2
"Today, after searching for a reset feature, I found that this is a common problem.",0
The only one flaw that I find significant is the difficulty in making the various settings.,0
"I think with these rebuilds (or actually I think this one was even advertised as new), you get the luck of the draw.",1
I am disgusted at apple after being ripped off by this macbook pro.Soon after receiving this trash I found out I could have gotten a vastly superior ASUS laptop for less than this.,0
"But others, including elderly viewers, may have problems with the matter, since the keys on the keyboard side of the remote are very small.",0
"Here is my situation... in addition to the basic communication functions, I expect my phone to keep my calendar, in sync with my MS Outlook (which also syncs with Google Calendar).",1
"They seem to have a good reputation so I decided to go with their 47"" smart TV.",2
"No idea on what that means for gamers, there's a discussion on amazon about this, consensus seems to be that 120hz is not better than 60hz.SOUND: Yeah, not so hot.",1
The picture quality is great!,2
The size of the display allows capture in low light for us vision challenged[ if you saw it you got it].,1
A great TV for a great price!,2
I really like this camera.,2
"After I described the issue and my troubleshooting so far, she set me up with their service department and they're sending someone to my house to fix it free of charge.",2
"DO NOT WAIT.great price as this machine clearly is worth 2x i paid for it today,being a student of law,and a avid writer,legal to songwriting it is amazing,how everything just looks on mi huge nice big screen,and new hp.i ADORE it all and trust me, you guys... Do not fret over WINDOWS 8!",2
LG CT810 is an economical alternative among smart phones.,2
No directions and I purcased the refurbashed model becouse it stated it had a one year in home warrenty I would like this in some type of writing they sent no pappers with it and hope amazon would look into this so i feel like i get what i am told as I love shopping on amazon hope for feedback thank you I provided my number....,2
"I can take hand held pictures of documents and drivers licenses, and they come out clear and printable.",2
Simple and cheap enough for what i needed it for.,2
"This is not covered by samsung, and if it happens to you, you will be denid by there warranty department!",0
In the short time that I have owned the camera I have found it meets my needs and mostly exceeds my expectations.No camera is truly automatic and can magically create a good photograph if conditions are poor.,2
"Good night The camera is bad, does not take pictures with flash, when I try to take them off the camera.",0
I also had issues with memory usage.,0
We live in a townhouse right adjacent to the street.,1
"It can be upgraded to Android 4.4, has great specs and it only costs 200$ this is in my opinion the best Android phone right now except maybe for nexus 5, if you are worried for the 16GB of storage then you can get 50GB free of google drive (too bad it is just for 2 years) the display is nice, the camera is good for the price but the rest of the phone is awesome i honestly have no regrets buying it.",2
"Well needless to say i couldnt activate it through boost haha, and even though it has been a very long time I received both a phone call and an email from this company wanting to correct the issue.",1
So I ran on v1001 for a while.,1
The front of the hand grip area of my camera is now slightly pushing out.,0
I've been using it for 3 weeks now and it still works as it did when it came out of the box.,2
Highly recommended for the discriminating viewer on a budget.,2
Ive given you the calibration settings so use the money you would've spent on calibration and buy a reciever.,0
"EDIT: You can read my initial impressions review below, but in the end, the SmartHub was such a disappointment (buggy, crashy, web browser was simply awful) I returned the TV.",0
There are thousands of bad apps for every good one.,1
I felt restricted by film costs (and environmental impact) and the limits of the ELF.,0
"I do not use the front-facing camera, but I can see how it would be nice during video chat.-  Size: it is wider and much thinner than the original Focus.",2
"I'm not a fan of flat cameras.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and Amazon's delivery was prompt - as always.Update: 12/28/2013I'm not sure if the camera had dropped but I'm unable to fully close the battery compartment.Now, I have to purchase a new camera just under one year of use.",2
"We're all about 21, trying to capture our end of 4-5 years of fun, and this camera is convenient and fun.",2
"Youll be glad you did.Also avoid the Samsung receiver, it is known to have a lot of problems.",0
That was mighty odd!,2
"But the phone doesn't come with a lot of memory, so basically no games.",0
They should be stored in the same place.,1
Disappointed that I wasted the money on it,0
We should have bought this camera months ago.,2
The first time we turned it on I was in awe of the crispness and the color of the screen.,2
A high quality plastic is good for lightweight and I go with lightweight than a heavy phone in the pocket.,2
")Conclusion:If your number one priority is a TV that looks great on the table/wall, then this is a good pick.",2
"Now the lens cap may jump off every time you turn the camera on, but it won't go very far because it is captured.2.",0
Looks good sounds good all around great set .,2
"It was great marketing, and the television was very pretty, but I noticed things that stuck out.",2
I got it for a few months now and it's the worst phone I ever had.Virgin's service is great.,0
"Also, it does show some light bleed in the bottom right hand corner.",0
Loved it!,2
"All I was doing was downloading a podcast, and the screen was off most of this time.Finally, if you are buying this device to use on T-Mobile's network, be warned, I was only ever able to obtain Edge data service even in areas where I had received 4g and 3g with my iPhone.",0
I believe its' purpose is to adjust picture brightness based on room ambient brightness.,1
"The best shots in films don't do a lot of zooming usually.- After making a video, edit it on your computer!",1
"(ONCE AGAIN)it is not a smartphone but close enough if you aren'tpicky.Music Player: It has an mp3 dependent on a micro SD card, AIMinstant messaging.",0
The picture is bright enough during the day and really pops at night with the lights out.,2
I had to track my box through several layers of semi-literate and quite rude phone jockeys from Home Direct shipping to Spirit Delivery (the company Home Direct contracted my delivery to) to get things right.,1
There is no setting to have it automatically delete old messages and that is a pain.I like to color screen on the outside on the phone so you can see who is calling and that you can set personal ringtones for each caller.,0
"The sat box and TiVO are connected HDMI; the DVD box is component.So far, I get an excellent HD picture with DirecTV and TiVO.",1
The quality of the TVs out there now as compared to the beginning of 2009 has changed a bit.,1
"(T900 also had the 32 min limit)-Great Slim Design, better battery door lock then DSC-t500-Panoramic mode is quick and painless with stunning results-10 FPS mode for action shots is great-Touchscreen works well, and looks great-It's fast to take photos-You can zoom during video!CONS:-Mono Microphone-3"" screen instead of the previous 3.5""-Amazing Low light quality doesn't seem to work in Video mode.-No actual video mode button (touchscreen based)-Zoom buttons seems awkward to use during filming-Battery/memory card is squeezed in camera's tiny body-4X optical zoom instead of 5X of DSC-T500If you search the internet for ""redban and dsc-tx1""  I have numerous videos and photo samples available from my full review.",2
I bought one online just like my friend did and am totally happy with the quality and ease of use.,2
It does the basics very well and seems well built.,2
My C series started having some weird lighting issues and they replaced it with this TV!,0
"It's been hanging in the living room for about 2 weeks now, and I have no complaints so far.",2
Picture quality in normal conditions is quite good.,2
"After it is full, some of your program which require the memory simply won't run unless you clean it up, which Nokia doesn't provide a good tool to do.- Tilt Sensor: Poorly implemented during calling/hanging up, I had to tilt and tilt the phone around and around to answer call and hanging up.",0
This shows that u really get wut u pay for.,0
"But then, that night, the TV did an auto-update of the software, which changed the setting back on, so the next day when my wife and kids were watching, they were squinting to see the picture since it was again auto-dimming, and they were clamoring about the broken new TV and how I had to fix it first thing.The user interface to the smart features is also junky.",0
It's much better than the old Kodak I replaced it with.,2
The buy as you go Tracfones are exactly what I need !,2
Cheers!,2
"If you buy, buy with caution.",0
"When you press the button, those 6 choices will be shown across the bottom of the display and you can quickly select and change the one you want using the navigation controls.One more thing to do is to enable the quick navigation display.",2
"I have discarded some too, but mostly because the conditions were poor; not because of the camera.I have found the camera is reasonably fast at focusing, though slower at full optical zoom.",0
It was on sale at Frys and BestBuy priced matched it with their Low Price Guarantee.,1
Its slightly faster with the 20-50mm lens indoors.,2
THIS IS ONEOF THE EASIEST CAMERAS TO USE.,2
I'll keep this one short and sweet.,2
First of all ask yourself what other options you currently have on the Blackberry market.,1
I hated this at first but it's only noticeable because the blacks are so intensely black.,0
"Besides this problem which is more annoying then anything, the tv does make up for it.",0
I assumed that perhaps somehow it didnt matter once i got the phone and saw that it said Verizon on it.,1
I like the color screen and the ability to do more than just read books.,2
That was definitely not acceptable.,0
It was a touchscreen Samsung with a slide-out keyboard.,1
The set up was great.,2
Why spend more for bells and whistles that hold little or no appeal to you?,0
"So I got a LG LA6200, so far seem LG is much better choice.",2
Voila!,
"It's super portable, I just throw it in my backpack and because of the battery life I just leave the charge cable at home.",2
"If the phone is connected with the audio cable and a call comes in, you have to unplug the audio cable for the phone to work.",2
This could be one of the best phones for calling or it could be one of the worst.,1
I couldn't get the email notification to work though - it just wouldn't work.,0
The pictures are crystal clear and you can make the font bigger so you can see it.,2
"It comes with two batteries, enough for a full day.The display has good quality but low resolution (which could be improved, but it's ok basic usage).If you want to install more than 2 or 3 apps, you must buy an SD card.",2
I wanted something that I could hoard for myself.,2
I recently bought it for myself because of the 30X.,1
"The rest of the features is on par with its rivals, including the maximum connectivity LTE and NFC.That if, as a work of engineering the Samsung smartphone stands out from the rest thanks to its spectacular screen size in the body content thinnest of the three, with just 0.34 in.",2
"It is okay with these shots, but when you actually zoom into your picture that you just took -the trees will be blending together with so much static.",1
"Have taken several thousand pictures since and as long as I keep my settings as stated I get great pictures.Just like my phone that I only want to talk on, I want a camera that works well without learning the 100 things it may be able to do.",2
"There is rolling shutter issues that happen with most CMOS sensors or whateva (like the d90), but it's only an issue when you're full on whipping the camera (not when turning).",0
Overall a great tv.,2
This is my bedroom t.v.,1
"It sadly stopped working due to one of my own personal errors.So i looked and looked, and i found this as its replacement!",0
Totally satisfied considering the size and cost.,2
"16 GB of internal storage seemed like a lot, but apparently my music and photo collection exceeds that, so I'll have to use an external hard drive.",1
To this we attach a very attractive design that has received very good reviews from those who have had their hands in appearance and comfort.SAMSUNG ATIV SProbably the most enigmatic of high-end phones with Windows Phone 8.,2
"MY SON HAD BEEN REQUESTING A NEW PHONE; THEREFORE, I MADE IT ONE OF HIS GRADUATION GIFT.",1
The only complaint me and thousands of other people are having is that the conductors on the board go bad.,0
"I called the carrier the following Monday, Aug 20th, after being transfered to the right person, she told me that she has NEVER been given any update on my phone number, so she couldn't contact me!",1
I may have minor complaints with some of Nikon's decisions placement on controls but overall I remain very pleased.,1
In the last few years I have purchased several plasmas and they just keep getting better.,2
"you want and don't listen to these other bloggers on what works for them!12)  if you still have trouble call the 800 service number for help...I haven't tried a 3D movie yet, but getting close...........enjoy, I think you've made a wise decision and saved money over the Samsung",1
"I'm pretty frank if I don't like something, but I really like this camera!",2
Subject was about 20 ft from camera.,1
"If you can climb successfully up the iTunes learning curve, you will do well, but you shouldn't enjoy it, if my experience is anything to go on.",1
Perfect for our bedroom.,2
......,
"It doesn't change the fact that is a great phone though.Bottom line, if you're making the switch ask yourself if you are in desperate need of 3G network.",1
So far so good!,2
This means my daughter loses all of her pictures before she has a chance to download them.,0
This has that feature but you cannot use the video screen; you have to look through a tiny view finder.,0
I don't plan on taking it with me anywhere or even touching it again for a while so this is not a large consideration.The remote is a mostly good experience.,2
The wi-fi feature is fun but I don't know how practical it is.,1
"It took Samsung about a couple of weeks to mail the glassesTV Cons:-the channel list does not show what programs are playing on each channel unless you've already watched that channel.-whitish corners are noticeable when displaying a dark picture-glare during daylight can be pretty annoying.-once every few days it just reboots itself while you're in the middle of watching something.App Cons:Since apps are just software, it is possible that all the following issues could be fixed with a software update, but I'm not holding my breath.",0
IT ALSO DOES WONDERS WITH VIDEO RECORDINGS...I RECORDED A FASHION SHOW AT THE SISTERHOOD SHOWCASE AND IT WAS DIVINE!!!,2
I had it going in just a matter of a few minutes.,1
He orginally had the Nikon Coolpix.,1
!,
"The slow autofocus is not something you want, ever, if you want to take pictures of wildlife or children.",0
The screen goes black after about 10 minutes of playing live TV.,0
Conclusion:  probably a manufacturing defect of some kind.Pros:*small and easy to carry*easy to turn the flash on and off*most settings are only a couple of menu selections away*Battery life actually seems pretty good for a camera this smallCons:*picture quality is horrible.,2
The picture quality is quite good but not quite as sharp as my existing Samsung Flat Screen TVs.,1
I am a little disappointed with the zoom.,0
This Rebel T3i is amazing especially for beginners.,2
Most TV speakers are the weakest point of any set and using a reciever with speakers you can hook up as many HDMI devices and have one HDMI cable from the reciever to the TV negating the lack of inputs on the TV itself.,0
It exceeded my expectations and definately was exactly what I was looking for!,2
that is why I upgraded everything.,2
The Chromebook exceeds my expectations.,2
My fault though as I did not do my homework about this product.,0
The first one being that there is hair underneath the screen.,1
Just threw it in trash.,0
"Otherwise, you will be running with a ""FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY"" and could get ticketed unnecessarily!!",0
"First bought the 26"", and it is quite good for all the reasons stated by others.",2
"I can take it with me everywhere I go.You can be anywhere in the World and as long as you have a WiFi connection, your phone numbers will be active for incoming and outgoing VoIP calls.",2
"The update also installed skype, which you can use by plugging a webcam into the usb port.Not five stars due to the channel surfing lag and the initial letdown.=================================I have owned various LCD TVs, ranging from Samsung to Panasonic to Toshiba.",2
Your signature on our carrier's delivery receipt acknowledges that you understand our return policy.,1
I upgraded to the S5 from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus.,1
2x free app is a must for saving the battery draw.,2
"This phone met and exceeded all my expectations, there's not one single reason why I would not strongly recommend it.",1
I often can't recognize what is the selected object or link or button.,0
"I have to admit i was considering giving this phone 5 stars, but then i also thought I could easily give 3.",1
"It included a Camera, Ethernet Cable, mounting brackets, CD, and Wireless db gain antenna.",1
"Sound is sufficient, picture is clear on HDMI,and the DVD/CD works well.",2
Would not buy again had I read the reviews.,0
"For those that haven't embraced Windows 8, the upgrade to Windows 8.1 will ease your transition (free upgrade on this machine.",2
The biggest improvement is battery life.,2
"you have friends) and worry that paying 10 cents per minute would add up pretty quickly, then you might also want to look at T-Mobile's pre-paid $30-per-month plan which includes 1,500 minutes and 20 MB of data access.",1
They also had to send a tech out to replace the board in this TV when it bricked during a firmware update.,1
I have this in the living room and can see in the kitchen and surrounding areas.,1
To me it's not a detriment - I like it - a lot!,2
I purchased a Vizio E390VL last week from my local Costco ($399.99) and couldn't be happier.,2
"outputs.The TV is supposed to come with cable to help convert the signal per the manual, however mine did not.",0
"But, if you are serious about photography and want room to grow, or you are a photo enthusiast, semi-pro  or pro, you would be hard pressed to find a camera with a better price/functionality point.",1
"However, the mouse touchPad, as CNET editor's review mentioned, most time, it lags behind finger movement.",0
"Definitely be careful swapping out lenses in any windy area that you know could potentially carry dust, dirt or sand particles that could get into your camera.",1
"I definitely recommend using it with a ethernet, Wifi sometimes can be a problem",1
If they're still available its definitely worth the price.,2
I got about one good picture.,2
It's only been a few days but I'm hoping to get around to playing with the smart feature soon and see how easy and accessible it is to stream Netflix and Hulu.,2
Flash CF.,1
I Would rather have my packages shipped to me via another means like fedex or UPS.,0
"Just about 13-14 months after purchasing the camera, it sits on my desk as a paper weight while I try to sell it as broken on an auction site.",0
"I still have not received the USB, so I am a bit frustrated that I cannot use the Smart feature of the TV.",0
I will be buying 4 more for presents.,1
"Unlike my S7000, the S4500 does not have a diopter adjustment for the EVF making for a fuzzy view through the EVF and the camera unsuitable for my use.I should have researched my purchase more thoroughly.",0
Upon opening the package I noticed the phone was insanely light!,2
I'm glad they got rid of the shiny silver look.,2
Bought as xmas gift last yr and 2wks ago the screen started going black w no sound also tv makes a buzzing noise tried customer service w amazon no luck tried haier was told take it to tv repair and pay get it fixed.,0
Did extensive comparisons with the Panasonic 3d TV but bought this one because it is thinner and I might want to eventually mount on a wall.,1
"While both are smaller for bedrooms, if they keep this up I will find myself replacing my 67"" Samsung with one of theres...we'll see, but for now I recommend getting a Vizio for a nicely priced bedroom TV",1
"My son, a 450-pound muscular monster in a size 16 shoe, stepped on the phone by mistake (at least he said it was).",1
I just decided to disable the auto sensing feature all together.,1
To me a no contract phone should mean you can use it with any carrier.,1
Very good buy for the price,2
Would never go back.,0
"The phone is exactly the shape she said it would be and i am pleased with the screen, normally used phones have scratches if even minor, and it does not have a scratch in the screen at all.",2
Out the box set up was easy.,2
I challenge you to find that on this sales page on Amazon.,1
"Although over all, I am happy with it.",2
"In fact so great, it was hard to remember how difficult the picture actually was.",2
This is a nice TV.,2
I bought this over last year's model because that one states it does not work.,0
Great Tv for price.,2
"Can't believe the ""reviews"" I see out there about the ""buzz"" these Samsung plasmas make, or ""how weak the internal speakers are.""",1
But front pocket doesn't have the separate closing and isn't extremely big.,0
"This is my second Toshiba television (my first LED) and I must say I will never buy another Toshiba television again.To give credit where its due, the color of the picture is great, the design of the tv is sleek and elegant, the 120hz is smooth, and the features/internet capabilities are great.",0
"I love this camera, it takes great pictures, it is so user friendly, and is built like a tank but is really light.",2
I love Canon.,2
Canon needs to improve their sensor production in the next line.2.,0
We also bought an extra battery just for back up.,1
Don't waist your time buying this phone.,2
I live out in the country and after all the break ins that we have had this gives me peace of mind that I can have an aerial view of my property while my home security system keeps the house safe.,2
"it was easy to edit names for the inputs (e.g.,  tivo instead of the provided names).",2
Wow.,2
If you wanted to plug in an older computer it might be a problem.,0
It worked great and I loved this phone.,2
"Which is bull crap because as a post-production and audio engineer, it's useful to know what I'm dealing with.",2
"i love this tv beautiful picture  easy to use  i a, so very happy  with this set looking at as i write  it is beautiful",2
I bought it to work with Claro in Ecuador and I had no problems at all.,2
Also this phone is light very light.,2
"I travel a lot and I drag my laptop along so I can check news, email, etc, on something larger than my Blackberry phone screen.",2
The clarity is terrific.,0
"I then bought the 22"" LG led tv (LV2500) and in comparison the Samsung picture was so much crisper with no background picture noise but the colors were so much more reliable and consistently appropriate on the LG.",2
One disadvantage of this model is the small size of the keypad buttons.,0
"When I contacted Amazon to note it was not the bag depicted in the ad and was incapable of holding other ""gadgets,"" they agreed to ship another bag.",1
"Ok I admit I sat here with the box unopened wondering if I would ever get the set up to work, since I may type fast on the Internet but wires and plug in stuff never seems too have easy to follow instructions.You can add additional cameras and this set up is for day as well as nighttime use.",2
It certainly is not to me.,0
After a while it wouldn't slide out 100% like it did at first.,0
"I would give it a 5 , but Vizio needs to do something about there Quality Control first.",2
"As for storage, the Samsung is the most flexible, allowing internal choose a size 16 or 32 GB and appending its possible expansion with microSD cards.The camera is perhaps where worst comes stopped ATIV S compared to the other two competitors in the high range.",2
So I bought this non contract phone from Amazon last December.,1
The camera has a way to make the center subjects smaller than the subjects on the sides and smaller than they appear in real life.,1
"Nevertheless, there are also plenty of reviews commenting on bad photo quality.",0
don't do it  don't do it,0
"Bought as a gift for my sister-in-law, who fancies herself an amateur photographer.",1
I will try again now that I have used the camera a bit more and understand the settings better.,1
"Free shipping, though, so you get what you get.",2
"Hell, just buy the damn thing.",2
"* PSAM, wish that they include the PSAM in the rotary dial, rather than menu.",1
"Saved sales tax and free delivery..979 bucks for a GREAT 55"" LCD TV delivered to the door..No lags problems and sound is fine although I did hook it up to my Surround Sound system..No complaints..",2
Now here’s some truth The very things that made this look like a great deal are FALSE ADVERTISING what they don’t show on slick Asus designed sales page is <THE ACCEDENTAL DAMAGE PLAN IS A SINGLE USE PLAN>!!,0

Im goin on 6 days without being able to use the product I paid for no more than 1 month ago,1
The instructions included fail to provide everything that you need to know about phone operation and it will probably be necessary to download an LG owners manual or go to the Tracfone site to see an explanation of how all of it's features and settings work.,1
I hope this helps someone else make the decision easier than I did.,1
excellent help and learned by watching how to domyself for future.,2
"Some thoughts on it since I've had mine since July:Pros:- High resolution makes 70% of pictures extremely crisp, and it captures text documents and flowers perfectly (when using the right settings)- High amount of settings but I only use ""SP"" Scene Position, which has presets for Party, Night, Natural, Text, Flowers, Sport, etc.- Panorama (splices three horizontal photos into one) pics usually come out great if used on nature and not man-made stuff- Built-in ability to rotate images and correct red eye, among others, are very usefulCons:- Video capture, although 1080p HD, is extremely poor and (even more annoyingly) extremely space-consuming.",2

not sure why so many negative reviews.. this product is awesome..,2
"what i was really impressed of was the low light pics and the 3D shots obviously...and with under water shooting as well, this cam got everything u need in one piece...the only problem i found in it was the short life of it battery which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5...the cam wont last long..so its better to get an extra battery with u if you are going out on a trip or just a regular outing because it wont last for more than 4 hours.",2
"That dealer said the phone was blocked, probably stolen, and showed me the red print screen making that statement.",1
"It is light and a joy to use.Auto Mode - If you want to point-n-shoot, this is the best option, Takes great photo's and very fast auto focus.Scene modes are terrific - landscape, portrait, close-up, sport etc.Where I found this camera to shine is when you switch to program, Tv, Av, manual or A-Dep.",2

"The refresh rate is perfect for those very fast action movies, like The Bourne Trilogy.I will update this when my sound system is hooked up and I've used that set up disc mentioned above, but for the price, $1049, bought here on Amazon, I can put this in another room in two-to-three years and go bigger(70-80).It's worth the five stars to me.....",2

I think i want to buy it.,1
sound is very good !,2
"Actually, using the channel button takes you to only a fraction of the channels.",1
"The regular zoom works great on its own, but once you add that extra zoom (when you cross the little bar on the screen) the pictures come out blurry without a tripod, but this happens with all cameras with digital zoom.Overall, I'd say it's like wrapping up a professional quality camera into a point and shoot camera that anyone can use!",2

"This isn't much different at all, and most people just don't know how to use the remote intuitively.",1
"So If you dont want to waste your money, then do not Buy this phone.",0
The picture quality is fine for my needs although I would like to be able to adjust the flash intensity for close up shots (currently try to filter the light with my finger over the flash which somewhat works).,2
"It's nice to be able to see the kids sleeping in the middle of the night.-network extender sounds like a good feature, but I'm not going to use it.Cons:-no two way audio for this model.",2

Its awesome.,2
I do with Amazon Instant Video and Amazon Cloud Service.,1
Will need more time for real evaluation of camera itself.,1

"But, as far as the T V goes she loves it!",2

Streaming from Hulu Plus was great.,2

"I love it so much that when someone stole mine off an airplane I'd just left, that I ordered another within 24 hours.",2
during dark shots it looks like someone is shining a flashlight onto the face of the set.,0
"But, for now, I am loving it.",2
If you don't need the camera to be water proof and your at speeds less then 100mph the open back doors are the best way to go.,2
The prints are pristine.,2
"This is the second VIZIO tv I own and the picture quality and sound are great, have not had any problems with the set.",2
I write the comment in this way because Amazon is not giving me the option to contact the seller.,1
"This was the first time I purchased on Amazon, but I will do it again..",2
Tv only weighs 50 something punds.,2
I had been slowly working my way up to owning a professional camera with the hopes and dreams of becoming a wildlife photographer when life threw me for a loop and suddenly i'm going to be living pretty much out of a suitcase for a very long amount of time.,1

The camera could not have been jostled in some manner ..DON'T BUY CASIO PRODUCTS!!!,0
It does everything I need and more.,2

it is a great camera  and i couldnt have asked for better from his kind of camera.,2

Product as per specification except for the earphones which is not provided in the box.,1
The ability to set up motion and sensor triggers to capture images was a great feature that I hadn't planned on.,2
I feel like I'm back in the days of the first android phones.,1
I was a genius and ran that phone thru the washer and dryer.,1
"I have a 6 month old, so it's crucial to be able to take pictures quick and this camera is not doing the job well :(",0
Currently it's only good for Wi-Fi access and that's not worth a $300 phone to me.I'm pretty disappointed in this phone.,0
"We also tried many of the settings posted in the reviews, and while all of them made HD look even more gorgeous it just made watching regular tv even worse.",1
"This replaced a broken Nikon P500, which I was quite happy with until the card holder broke.",1
"The previous version of the phone had already won awards for best mobile device (Mobile News) and accolades for most innovative phone from Gizmodo and Engadget - but now the 1020 has added quite simply the best camera every seen on a smart phone.This is not just a small leap in camera capability or a slightly better quality - the pictures you can take with this phone are jaw dropping.I have taken a Canon DSLR pro camera out with this phone and am often jealous of the sharpness, color and capabilities of this tiny device.Show someone a picture and they say wow - then double click the screen and zoom in 6 times to show the sharpness is still there - and every one of them has said ""I want that phone"".",2
"They brought the TV in, unwrapped it, turned it on, made sure it was working, then took the outside wrap back with them.",1
It is super sturdy and has no trouble being tossed in a backpack and going along for a hike with you.,2
"But honestly you are better off paying for a real dslr, or using a bridge camera.",0
"I have a home theater room with 100 inch screen and cant wait to get a 3d projector (not available yet in 1080p), but would recommend the largest 3d tv that you can afford, and 63 inches to me is only a half as large as I think is optimum.Sony and LG are supposed to come out with 3d tvs this June in time for the ESPN 3D launch for World Cup Soccer.",1
"So, I love it that this camera is completely idiot proof for taking awesome quality continuous shots.3) Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo.",2
I thought they'd go the way of the buffalo when film became passe'.,1
Nothing matches the SZ-12 in its price range.,1
I get false alarms when the sun goes behind the clouds; yet someone can walk right in the center of the picture and not trigger an alarm.Recording does not start fast enough.,0
"First, the wifi sometimes disconnects out of the blue and I would have to turn it off and on again.",0
It's in the seller's hand to make good on this now.,1
Just push the 3D button while playing these movies or displaying these photos.,1
They appear as black dots.,1
I try to not notice it and mostly don't until I'm watching NatGeo and my stupid fat face is sitting right there between the lions stalking the water buffalo at night.PS.,1
"I heard a lot of other reviews on amazon saying that the stand wasn't the best made, I sort of agree with that.",0
"Checking on reviews at various sites also led me to believe the SX500 IS was at least comparable, and usually better than the other 30x ""ultra"" zoom cameras.After playing around with it a few days, mostly on the Auto setting, I'm very happy with the optical zoom and the image stability you get at 30x, better than I got with the Lumix at 10x.",2
It's relatively cheap for the quality that you get out of it.,2
"These SmartTV apps are a bit slower to start up, but they otherwise work great.All in all, I'm extremely satisfied with this television.",2
The camera feels great in your hand and performs very well.,2

If everything in life were this easy!,2
Would definitely recommend.,2
Don't think twice.... just buy it.,2
Only annoy thing I found is having to convert my videos to play on iPhones as it only records in AVCHD.,0
"Other than the included kit lens, the lenses for this system tend to be larger than those for the Olympus, Panasonic, and Nikon competitors in the mirrorless camera segment.- With the included zoom lens, the camera has to apply a *lot* of distortion correction as you get to either extreme of the zoom.",1
The quality of the pictures is just amazing.,2
No complaints here!,2
I have taken about 1700 photos so far and am very happy with the quality of the images.,2
Totally flawless.,2
The picture has been flawless and it functions without issue.,2
This Christmas I purchase one le pan  tc 97 9.70and another android from China Mica oneI have both and there no comparison the le pan is excellent bright colors is just like the other reviews one excellent tablet I recommend and I also want to emphasize do not order from China you will have the hardest time you your life to return or fix a problem.,1
Thank you for making my shopping experience a joy!,2
"Cannot zoom the lens in movie mode.Were I to buy it again, I would also consider the Pentax Optio W80 and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS1 since reviews say picture quality is better and they shoot HD video.",1
These cameras are great and so easy to use.,2
"That's what I was looking for is a tough ""General Phone"".",0
But as a owner of the previous model i'm spoiled.,1
After v1009 this problem which used to occur 100% of the time not happens maybe 10-20% of the time.,1
"When we received the TV, the power cord on the back was loose and the frame is cracked, the box from UPS was in perfect condition, not sure when the damage happened.",0
I ordered a black phone for my son and we recieved a purple one.,1
"Google Now is understandably, still relatively new - but how does the phone not have some form of notification center?",0
I hope to have this for a very long time.The battery life is terrific!,2
(These are not for kitchens).,1
!,
I looked for the best price and got it through Amazon.,2
Landed in the middle with 4 stars in the end.,1
"Or even just open the box first before offering for a ""fabulous"" deal.",1
The touch screen works like it should and the apps and programs respond for the most part!,2
"Mine has been bounced, scratched (except for the lens protector which seems to resist scratching; awesome!",2
"but until 19th, 5 days after the TV arrived at my town, I still didn't get a call.",0
It quickly does hit a brick wall and the apps fall dramatically in quality.,0
and dropped the camera on the sidewalk!,1
"I now have a camera that streams live when I request it, but constantly records onto a Micro SD Drive so in case I need to review the backup footage.Being able to check up on my mom to make sure she is ok. Priceless!",1
On my Canon's simply pressing the picture preview button will let you view pictures without the lense extending.,2
**************************Just got this set from Amazon about 3 weeks ago after laboriously weeding out others because of size/features.,1
GREAT PHONE FOR UNDER HUNDRED DOLLARS.,2
This was a disappointment since I rely on CEC to keep my HTPC in sync with my TV and  use my TV remote to control my HTPC.,0
Virgin Mobile is so much cheaper and great service.,2
"The sound is clear, loud enough, but it is hung on the wall in my bedroom so I am not really cranking it.",1
"I did not expect this camera to do well indoors or in low light, but I didn't realize how poorly it would perform in these situations.",1
I'll start by saying I am a general fan of Samsung products.,2
"It beats passing out dollar bills, as I have in past travels, and you can still do that, as well, if you are so inclined.",1
Don't buy this product.,0
"I bought this camera to use for art purposes, but I am using for business right now.",1
"CRTs can produce true dark blacks and I think that is a very important part of the movie experience.Although this tv weighs in close to 200lbs, you can have somebody like Crutcfield or SonyStyle, deliver it in your home completely free of charge!",2
However i pay for the Xbox and it's live services.,1
I have no complains its a great and a must buy TV!,2
I consider voice dialing on this unit useless.,0
It takes a bit of time to study the users manual but the camera can be used  almost intuitively.,2
This 60is hz bumped to 120 by cleara motion is blur horrible.,0
"Of all the point-and-shoot, pocket cameras out there, this one finally delivers speed.",2
"One of the nice features I loved on my Pearl was the fact that the Usb charger was very popular, so even if I lost my wall charger I could always find a Motorola charger to plug it in to, buy one for 3 bucks, or just grab any of the supplied USB cables from an external hard disk, PS3 controller, mp3 player, etc, and just recharge it using my computer.",2
Easy set-up and no wires to run.,2
"For that price, you are in the same range as the various e-readers such as the Kindle Fire (did I mention it has e-reader apps available?).",2
I'm not sure why I put it off as long as I did.,1
Did Samsung suddenly decide that a standard SD card is just too heavy??,1
"Got this one for the wife to replace another COBRA that didn't cover some of the newer bands ... everyone liked it so much, we upgraded the other 2 drivers to this unit.Chose it because it had the range and features w/o the stuff that costs more that we didn't care about ... touch screen, GPS speed trap and stop-light notification (although it is an available option on this unit), stuff like that.It's always that speed sign you missed due to a large vehicle, or poor positioning, or the one time you are not paying as much attention that you normally do that you get snagged.",2
"However, this is my first camera purchase ever; but for those single-use things.",1
Compared to the S3: Apps snap open; Windows slide smoothly; Calls are made and answered instantaneously.,2
It's really not much to speak of but still worth noting.,1
GREAT,2
Couldnt ask for more.,2
"You can surf the internet, watch Netflix, surf YouTube, or get on Facebook with just the TV remote control--among other features.",2
It's gorgeous.,2
Worth the money and only complaint is brightness had to be turned up.,1
"I have an 18 mm f/3.5, but it cost as much as the DSLR body and barely equals 28MM effective, whereas the DSC-HX1 has a 28 mm:f/2.8 equivalent built into the 500 mm f/5.2 telephoto.",1
"Instead, you get 4 cheapo alkalines that last about 5 minutes (no exaggeration).",1
With this camera you just have to get it close and the software will line it up automatically.,1
"Higher MP, VASTLY increased ISO, better native resolution, bigger lcd screen and better res, weights 100g more (one of the few negatives), better viewfinder coverage, more movie formatting options, HDR, focus points vastly increased, shutter lag halved, battery life increased by 100 shots, continuous shooting up 35% - from 3.9fps to 6fps, 2 stoarage slots instead of 1, and now accepts SD cards along with CompactFlash Type 1.",2
Canon is an excellent products.,2
The mini SD card (an extra) is a great way to transfer photos to PC.,2
This Cruz Tablet is nothing more than a 300 dollar book reader that you can check your email on.,0
It does everything and is very easy to use.,2
Theorize that this phone is more compatible for wireless down south?,1
I had purchased this camera specifically for taking landscape shots and it worked exceedingly well for that application.,2
It never fails.. Has a great picture.. alerts me if there is movement or sound in the house..Even worked the entire time Hurricane Sandy was hitting my house.. Never failed..,2
For some reason half the button presses wont respond or you have to hit the center of the button on the remote to get it to respond.Other than that the tv is great for video gaming and movies.,1
I don't.,1
"It was the ONLY 37"" I could find, it seems they do not make them any longer.The only problem I had was the tv has a small indentation on the screen at the top center.",1
Would not recommend this camera at all!!,0
I received it in a timely manner intact and put it to good use after charging the battery.,2
The features are perfect.,2
I recently bought this product and I can't say enough about it!,2
"On the whole I was disappointed with the picture quality, and will probably take the camera in to have the lens cleaned and/or checked for moisture in the lens.",0
"It does much of what I used my Ipad for (music, books, news, etc.).",1
"For instance, when deciding you need to override the camera's exposure setting using exposure compensation, you'd want to be able to view the live histogram.",1
As I'm still a relative newbie with Samsung tvs...having just purchased a Samsung 46 led a couple of months ago...Let me say they make a gorgeous tv screen... night and day difference between a 46 Sony Brava that failed on me and prompted the need for replacement.,2
I would have no qualms recommending this camera for people who sell on Ebay as a result of its strong macro performance.,2
"Also, this phone gets reception in places that my smartphone does not.",2
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.,1
Beats me.......I don't get it.,1
The SX50 has an optical view finder which is helpful in the bright sunshine.,2
got sick for 11months other ppl took over hm never recieved this item.,0
And its not small!,2
Love this camera!,2
I recommend adding a protective screen protector to lessen the potential for the glass shattering if it takes a hard fall.,1
"Excellent quality pictures, camera in great shape.All functions work.Honestly i did not just get a used camera, i got an outlet for my artistry",2
Re-charging of the provided re-chargeable battery is done with the provided USB-cable and the power adaptor.,1
On Toshiba's end the phone support has been friendly enough and I've been informed a tech will provide onsite assistance but I've been given the run around by Nexicore (the 3rd party repair service).,1
It shuts off after 10 minutes.,1
and since the room is very large I am situated very far away.,1
"Also, I have downloaded some very graphic/ram intensive games and the action is smooth and the video amazing.",2
It is awesome.,2
I have great hearing and I have to turn the volume up in the 80's to hear it and then it has a horrible static.,0
"For years I struggled with that stupid little thing, I couldn't find it, couldn't see it, couldn't hit those tiny buttons with my big fingers and since all the apps were extra and I didn't know what they were for, I didn't purchase any.",0
If you are thinking about the Nikon COOLPIX L620 18.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 14x Zoom Lens and Full 1080p HD Video (Black) because of the sometimes slightly cheaper price and more megapixles I would still urge you to get this camera!,2
"Other useful things I can control are sharpness, saturation, contrast, and flash intensity - things I haven't seen in the other 6 digital cameras I've owned.",2
"With a particularly steady hand or a tripod, this camera also excels in low light.",2
"People, scenery, sports, playstation games, etc.",1
"But then I saw this television in a local retailer and was very pleasantly surprised at the picture and the price.It's got a wonderful picture, built in wireless, streaming apps and plenty of input ports.",2
I enthusiastically give it five stars!,2
I think that's a recipe for eventually knocking the lens off kilter (and perhaps why Nikon apparently gets complaints of lens errors on some of their cameras).,0
Nikon seems to be very reluctant to fix the problem.This is the first Nikon product I have purchased.,0
"The picture isn't crystal clear, but for the peice, it is a steal.",2
I would say its bit on the softer side when you see for sharpness and also the noise is a bit more compared to nikon point and shoot.,1
"I was basically only using the browser on my Windows laptop, so the Chromebook 550 is perfect.",2
"Now, we've been more than two weeks on the rechargeable batteries, without being recharged.",2
Ralph Mendez was very helpful in quickly setting up my camera to my computer and iPad.I have recommended these cameras to other as it is an EXCELLENT product!Needed additional help with port forwarding.,2
I went through all the work of mounting it and then it simply would not come on.,0
"It's not that noticeable, but it is something to think about.",1
I was excited to get the Cruz Tablet and after a couple weeks of use I find it to be an expensive e-reader that you can also use as a paperweight.,1
"Edit as you go, and post on-line from the cd - there's enough storage space to shoot all day, and the battery bounces back to 100% with a quick re-charge.",2
"It's fast, it was cheap (62 dollars), the placements are a little on the weird side, but the fact that it's so cheap and is comparable to my high end tablets, I'd definitely recommend buying this.",2
"This is my sencond cybershot, the first was great unfortunately they don't make them anymore.",1
"the picture quality is amazing, the dual hdmi hookups allow two hd devices to be connected at once, and its extremely easy to set up.",2
"The overall quality of the phone and the android system is great, and the camera and video is AMAZING.",2
When I got this camera I dived straight into using manual mode.,1
Thank you!,2
.,
They don't service if only one dot on your screen...very disappointed in this very poor customer service policy.,0
"I've had this Vizio 55"" 3D/240htz Smart for several days.",1
"The phone well built, doesn't feel cheap (good materials and tough).Battery life is very good, she charges it every three days and she really uses it.",2
"Every webpage I've opened loads in full quickly and without a hitch.Setup is a breeze (all you need is your google account and your wifi password), and I had all my preferences in terms of interface and security set up in roughly 15 minutes.",2
I liked the surface I bought so much that I bought one for my wife.,2
It is a dream compared to my other phones.,2
Switched back to wired connection.,1
"This is a great system, I really like it.",2
Very uniform light distribution.,2
"The only complaint I have is that the color is a little off (to the pink side), but not enough to rate this camera lower.",1
"I'm sure the newer Spyder4 is just as good, but with this, I was very pleased.",2
Highly recommended.Olympus Stylus Tough 8010 14MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Blue),2
"If something does happen this will capture a vehicle, license plate or picture of someone outside the property.",1
I was impressed.,2
"Still haven't installed them, but I have tested them, both my husband and I was really impressed by the overall quality.",2
"I haven't put the cleaning kit or the SD card reader to the test (no need to - my computer has an SD reader built in), but will update if I do use them.",1
"Seriously I would just call customer service, they are some of the best people I've ever experienced from any company.",2
"I hate the fact that it has to be cleaned and dusted even though I love doing that, but I'm afraid it's always going to scratch it every time.",0
"The 3.2 MP camera is actually pretty decent, not the best, but just right.",1
it was delivered on time and there wasn't a scratch on the box.,1
"The camera will often use high ISO, which cause your pictures to be grainy.This is the third fuji i own, I had the A3000 and the S1500.",1
Google map your house and check out the sat photos on the big screen!The high def is exquisitely crisp and the sound is really much better than I had hoped.,2
It's a good temporary solution to monitor what's going on in  your vicinity.,2
Button placement is similar but different.,1
Turns out my MacBook found it easily using the Macintosh find app on the CD - except the provided CD is not in a format the Mac will read!,1
"When it did work, this camera performed better than expected.",2
CONGRATULATION SON  CLASS OF 2014.,1
I improved to 8GB Kingston HyperX 1600MHz SODIMM 204-pin RAM.,1
"The television is thin, light, and the menu options are easy to navigate.The tv came in via amazon and I am pleased to say there was no damage and the delivery was fantastically quick.",2
"Comparing to my D7000, the D610 performs much better, producing much sharper images.",2
My kids used to bring along an audio-only monitor... they were so impressed with this camera and the ability for it to work in Infrared - and to view it on the iPad - they have ordered one for themselves.The setup for allowing access to the camera outside your local network does require some specialized knowledge on how to configure port forwarding on your router.,2
"The biggest draw back is that if you want to add two (2) more cameras, they cost as much as this system.",0
I have a standalone PIR from X1 that is very reliable and immune to sunlight.,2
Great if you don't print to paper and do not have a PC around.,2
It may be overkill for the average user but will certainly meet the needs of most people.,2
The receiver has a tuning knob that easily tuned into the right frequency.,2
I do not understand why a manufacturer would build an HD TV and not provide the necessary HDMI cable to go with it.,0
Took it on vacation.,1
")Picture & Sound & 3D:  I think both the picture and sound are excellent, but I'm no expert on those matters.",2
Thank you.,2
"But, if you are the type of person that notices high pitched sounds, is easily annoyed, needs a silent room for sleep: this aspect will drive you nuts.",0
"Or at least the $199 35mm F1.8 AF-S DX....Conclusion:* This is a day-to-day candid camera that serve BEST image quality ever offered by camera of this size* Do not expect BOKEH, or professional look portrait!",1
It took longer to get than other items ordered from Amazon.,0
I'm a deployed soldier.,1
Just got it two weeks back.,1
I have had to miss work waiting on repair techs who do not stick to their scheduled appointments (hours late!),0
"Minor quibble.- It's not free :-)There's really a lot to like about the D300, and very little to dislike.",2
"If someone walks quickly enough across the field of view, the recording will miss them.You can't control the length of alarm-generated recordings.",0
I'd definitely buy another one.,2
It has full manual settings as well as aperture preferred or shutter preferred auto settings.,2
"If u need a ok and cheap phone for the short term, I'd reccommend this one.",2
I only shoot in Manual Mode and RAW files.,1
"Using features requires signing up for more Internet media account (samsung.com, DivX, ...).",1
But when I went back to play or save recorded video there was no audio.,0
"Infuriatingly, the battery died after being fully charged and our taking two pictures within a month after we got the camera.Also be aware that this camera has a smaller (""mini"") memory card than previous versions, so you have to buy new memory cards to use it.",0
Apple can't even compete with that!,2
"I signed up for automatic payments (payments charged to my card monthly automatically)  Currently I'm dealing with a text message that says, ""Your rate plan did not renew due to low account balance,"" - which is absurd since I have PLENTY of funding.",0
Love my new prepaid LG phone.,2
"But after going through all the settings and customizing everything to suit my needs, this phablet works beyond expectation.",2
"The path to change settings is difficult to find, even when reading directly from the fine print of the user manual.",0
The phone also seems to hang up when typing to accessing web pages more than my old phone.,0
"If you only want to take pictures of landscapes and sightseeing, then this is indeed a very good option, and I would recommend that you track down the Samsung NX 16mm f/2.4 Camera Lens (Black) to use with it.",2
"When I confronted the service representative about lying about the RAM (Intel directly states a maximum RAM capacity of 32GB and I know someone directly who is currently running 16GB in the same notebook) they gave me an attitude of not caring with ""8GB has tested by asus and it is steable and safe"".",0
Pictures that are sent to you are stored in a different place than pictures that you take with the camera phone.,0
"The battery life is also supposedly short, but I always get a spare (2 for $15).",1
I rate them less then zero.,0
It is easy to use and FUN.,2
Instead of my zeepad they sent me a Yeahpad!!,1
Got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she loves it.,2
"Own a 60"" and thought that it would be just as slim and with a remote control that has the keypad on the back.",1
The big difference with the 40D will be the new 10 megapixel sensor.,1
It even has the sound of the shutter clicking and the film winding sound also.,1
I may pursue the matter with LG.,0
I told my wife that I couldn't believe they were regular DVDs.,2
"I upgraded, had this camera for 2 days and then sold it and bought the S700 again which is now costing more then this one which I know why.. Its a whole lot better.",1
"In checking with Olympus support they confirmed that I was pretty much ""up the creek"" where this product was concerned and that the newer models now record in the "".AVI"" format, which seems to be more popular.",1
"I'm not sure what the motivation was, but it was a major waste of time on my part.........pretty amazing I thought.",1
"In the end, you apparently are no different from any other PC manufacturer, other than you charge more for your product.",0
Great Picture and excellent sound.,2
"Toshiba has given me several case numbers to contact Nexicore, I have called Nexicore twice and they have no record of any case number for my situation.I really wanted to like this TV, but I just can't.",0
"Before you buy this TV go google ""Lns 4041dx takes forever to turn on"".",0
The on-line manual and printed guide to its many features are written very clearly.,2
"I'm not sure how, but I'm not happy.",0
corporate greed.,1
Will provide more details after the holidays.,1
I would recommend putting in more ram and getting an SSD installed - something I will be doing hopefully in the near future.,1
Its just a bit but when scrolling channels its noticeably slow and irritating.,0
I recently to my friends shows the details of processes.,1
"Just like all the other reviews, its definitely not an IPAD but if you are looking for something like an IPAD than get an IPAD!",1
I use my 500GB external HDD on it all the time as well as my 8GB flash drive too.,1
I love the quality of the picture and the ability to use the internet straight form the TV itself.,2
i literally had to click on a thread 2-5 times to finally see my friggin txt message!,0
This was the only TV that fit the bill so I went ahead and bought it.,1
"We missed opportunities to document, with much better pictures, some very important family events.",1
"I'm very much impressed with my new 40"" TV.",2
I am going to try connecting it to a fire tv and if that doesn't work I am going to buy a shotgun and blow it up.,1
"Light and easy to use, this makes a great pocket camera.",2
"Side to side, there is no comparison in overall capability/flexibility.",1
This is such a nice investment!,2
Great little camera for the money.,2
I gave this as a gift and was quite pleased with the image and clarity.,2
Shot video and snapped some nice pictures so far.,2
I have numerous devices that are 50+ feet away from router and work fine including a Wii game console attached to the TV has no wifi issues..,1
I would not consider the Canon because the review says it doesn't easily fit into a pocket.,0
"The top left corner of the screen cracked spontaneously despite being handled with care, which seems to be a common defect of the product.",0
I reminded them each time that I had a tracking number and signature proving that it had been received.,0
i just don 't think it should have taken that long... period.,0
"Seeing the price variations in last month, we got the BEST deal...",2
Sleek small and light.,2
Here is a picture of it http://i.imgur.com/dJjUI8P.jpg Not sure if it is only happening on this set though.,1
Let me start off by saying I've bought Canon's since their 2MP models and each one I've loved more than the one before it.,2
"Great boot-up time, like 5 seconds!",2
The Sony NEX-5R struggled with the low light without the flash.,0
They installed it but it didn't work.,0
"So, where was that in the installation troubleshooting guide?",0
"It does not have internet connectivity, or the Viera suite of tools like other Panasonic TV's.",0
""", before slipping the camera back into my pocket.Away from the great outdoors, the flash combines well with the dynamic ISO seting, and allows good head shots across the dance floor at parties.Oh, and the usual thing from Canon CCDs that have minimal cascade even in low light conditions; near-black photos still have little sparkle in the image, just as it should be.And I have found good macro pictures, which I didn't expect.",2
"Didn't realize it until after the 30-day period so neither the store or LG would help.Again, for the money, you can find better TVs, such as the Samsung models that actually give you a choice of inputs.",0
This allows us to place the TV where it was needed without having to worry about running cable.,2
I was having issues with my past camera becuase it wasn't quick enough.,0
The best tv I ever had.,2
These issues are only a problem when you are trying to use other modes.,1
The -7 has higher stills resolution.,0
"Obviously not a huge deal if you are watching in a dark room, but just something to be aware of if it's near a window or if you prefer to watch TV with the lights on.2.",1
!,
"She originally wanted an Ipad Mini but after receiving this tablet, she has not made a peep about any other tablets.",2
It does take a bit to get used to.The clarity of this screen is what surprises me the most.,2
The first time I used this camera it kept taking a zillion photos even though nothing was moving all night in my office.,1
"All great cameras, but the D7000 has become my daily use camera.",2
This aspect is oftem overlooked by many manfactures.,1
"I ordered this TV from Amazon in March and waited for 3 Days to have it delivered, which was no problem.",2
I selected the Micro Cruz and have not been disappointed.,2
"everything looked great....until i watched a commercial with a white background noticed there were dark ""waves"" running through the screen, yikes!",0
Nowhere in he ad did it say Verizon.,1
A day early thanks to signing up for prime.,2
"nice size screen for small room, good price",2
"Wrong.The engineer came, replaced the touch pad, no work.",0
"Obviously, this is either a defect in the TV or a poorly configured feature that is reacting to itself.",0
Pictures are good but the auto focus has trouble at times.,1
"So before we went away I checked, cleaned and lubed all of the seals but once again the water got in and the camera is done.",0
Of course there's many ways to do this but I wanted something easy to interface with for me and my wife.,1
"So, believe you me, I was hesitant when I decided to buy the Samsung WB250f to replace the P330 but, for all the reasons above and half the price, I couldn't be happier, so far.",2
did an update on the ziio7 8gb and after a couple of hrs while reading the manual for the tablet it froze up solid.,0
I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas.,1
"This previously very-satisfied Finepix digital camera customer, is now looking at Canon and Nikon digital cameras.",1
The start up time is somewhere around 20 seconds or less in some cases.Score- 9.8/10Features/toucscreen/Sound-This tablet features Google Play and it's very easy to setup.,2
I am not in love with the stand.,0
You can also assign a picture to a caller.,1

I will start by saying that I an amateur photographer.,1
And ALL reviews for this TV that say internal cracks are intact not for this TV but a similar one from the year before!,1
"One caveat - If you are getting something under 37"" - seriously think about whether 1080p is important, you'll need to be really close to get the full experience and is it worth the money to you?",1
I had purchased this for vacation and it didn't work right out of the box.,0
"1080p and 1080i output settings, respectively.",1
I have been an ipad user for years but when I got this tablet for my daughter I fell in love with it!,2
Even while moving the mic does a great job at reducing wind noise.,2
I couldn't get anyone interested in repairing a $300 TV so I eventually had to buy another one.,1
")Operationally, AUTO mode produces inconsistent image quality compared to self-selecting the appropriate scene mode or leaving the camera in Easy mode (the default).",1
"And it also automatically uses a flash, and turns it off when the flash is not necessary because its too bright.",1
"You don't have to use mydlink, but you can't use the mydlink app without it and remote access is more difficult without ti.Pros:-good video and audio quality.-once it's setup, it just works.-the app works well on my iphone 5 and ipad 3.",1
"so I came across this one; although never bought anything ASUS but i know their laptops are good, so i went for it, not expecting much!",1
the quad core processing unit makes gaming easy and reading smooth.,2
"I payed the few extra bucks to get this model over thw base model, and what a mistake.",0
The battery life is very long (I have only charged it 2 times in the last 3 months that I have had it).,2
It worked well at first.,0
"Although I hesitate to carry it everywhere since I have my iPhone to take snapshots, when my intention is to take a lot of pictures, this is what I use.",1
"perfect, Excellent reception and compliance and the team he wanted now I disfruarlo mucho y espero hacer negocios otra vez",2
"All these tree cameras take nice pictures but with DSC-H5 you can see immidietly on screen, while for others you have to transfer pics to PC.2) DMC-FZ7's body and design is not eye catching and it's plastic body feels very cheap.",0
"I love the pictures & although I'm still learning all the tricks, its easy to use and understand.",2
For whatever reason the PC search program would not find the unit on my network in spite of ensuring it was on the same router - never did and STILL doesn't after getting it setup properly.,0
"For video, it is best to get a high data rate card.",1
"So, the ONLY time I would use 1600 would be in LOW light situations where a printed photo won't be larger then maybe 5 x 7 or 8 x 10.Now the best part about having this camera, is there is a song about it.",1
"I must say that I feel that Nikon has created a giant killer (the competition, especially for Canon).",1
"In fact, because of the D70s' meter, I'd choose it over the D80.",2
"And using Activsync, all I have to do is plug my phone into a USB port and the calendar is updated within minutes.Technologically speaking, this is probably a couple years behind the curve.",1

"Netflix/Spotify/HBO Go all work great... the inclusion of HBO Go is huge.The remote is kind of gimmicky... not sure why I need a touch pad when a four way directional pad would suffice.Now to the bad part - after approximately one month of ownership, a vertical green line has appeared on my set.",1
Issue finally resolved.,1
"Over a dozen calls and two months later, I am STILL calling back daily trying to get the replacement shipped to me.",0
"I was surprised to see it only took one man to carry a 42"" TV.",1
"A couple years ago I got a couple of Lorex cameras from Radio Shack, and they're a bit smaller than these Zmodo cameras; I was expecting the Zmodo cameras to be as small as the Lorex ones.",0
They will never see another cent from me on any product they carry.,0
"It was not the Boost service bc I have used Boost b4 (with a diff phone and it was great)I also didn't like the touch screen on the front bc when I would talk, my face would press keys and calls would get dropped or the ppl I spoke to wpuld hear touch tones.",0
Whatever.,0

"The picture controls on this TV are pretty sparse too, so you won't really be able to dial in this TV.Performance:  Let me say up front that I am ecstatic with the picture of this TV for the price I paid.",2
It is perhaps one of the best product I ever used.,2
"Even though the ne one has a ""better"" screen,  I dont see how this one needs to be better.",1

This TV is amazingly clear.,2
"I never had service, the battery died every 20 minutes",0
"Stupid Apps: Most them have troubles while you play something, they always work 'sometimes'.2.",0
I feel like I'm maybe only getting like 85%-95% of what is possible out of this TV due to lack of literature.,0
But you do have to use 2 remotes.,0
"We are going between the Motorola MPB 36 and levana Jenna, which means we are throwing cost out of the window.",1
I really have enjoyed this camera because of all the settings that it has.,2
F2 starts wider at 24mm instead of 28mm equiv.4.,1
"So I ordered this Swann system and a few days later I get the ""package"".",1
"It required physically unplugging to get it to reboot.Another odd thing about this TV is that the universal remote actually involves snaking some included long wire and IR transmitter from the TV to sit 4"" in front of the main AV source (e.g., the cable set top box) and shine at its IR remote input.",0
"Overall, it is really a useful device and price is also quite reasonable.",2
i returned this phone the first week.,0
I decided to go back to Panasonic and got the ZR1.,1
That was the deciding factor between the D610 and D800.,1

Come on this is a new phone!,0
"I am sure there are going to be enough reviews this week to bump me down before anyone can read my review, so I'm just going to give my 5 stars and tell you, ""It's a ton of fun.""",2
"The big factors I was looking for: compact in size, optical or electronic viewfinder, 5x or more optical zoom, adjustable LCD display (LCD screen that folds out and can be adjusted to be viewed from different angles or closed towards the camera to protect it).",1
"The sound is awful, and that is exacerbated by the fact that in order to accomplish the ""slim"" design, the speakers face to the rear.",0
"I wish I had thought of this sooner!My only gripe is that the cables come rolled up, and tend to kink up instead of lying flat as my other cables do.",0
"This turned out to be a used phone,which looked new.",1
I bought my Asus 6 months ago.,1
***update 01/07/13*** Shortly after setting the tv up my wife began to complain the tv had an odor to it.,0
The picture quality is great.,2
Previous body was a XSi Rebel and have been looking to upgrade for the past year.,1
It even suits the professional because you can buy and add other lenses for the camera to make the pictures you take more beautiful.,2
"You need lots of light, so if you want to take pic's in a nightclub or in a bedroom when you get home (wink wink), get one that has a flash!!!",1
;,
Exactly what I ordered is what I got.,1
I don't mind commercials it's the freezing and sudden lose  of sound that bothers me.,0
... from the manufacturing location and it just FAILED!!!,0
Got this as replace meant for my Pentax K-10d.,1
"I am very happy with this tv!One more thing, noticed the item specification says no PIP, this is only partially true.",2
"so i wanted to write back and help toothe camera is great for its two functions of taking pictures and recording videos, its dual functions are awesome and less to carry.",2
"This is a great product that's for sure, however if you get one that needs a software upgrade, don't update it, especially if you use Netflix, it worked great for me until I finally updated the software.",1
Its irritating but no reflection on the device.,0
The up escalation team even playing the hard ball and asked me the follow their procedure to have onsite person to fix the touchpad.,1
It is all that I expected.,2
"So far, I have not had to use Lightroom 5.0 to correct many pictures.I have not had a chance to test the video, but then again, call me old-timer, but I use the DSLR for still pictures.",2
the kindle fire hdx is also extremely durable on its sides to protect from drops,2
For the most part it is an excellent camera and takes great photos.,2
Delkin states you can't put a battery grip on with their skin.,1
"Battery life is not good, but probably the same as other cameras in this category.",0
Wow I love this thing more and more every single day.,2
"If you have an old dvd , cd or vcr that no longer works , remove  the plastic front that covers the IR receiver .",1
The audio is soo low that I can barely hear anything on my Kindle Fire HD.,0
"I rarely game on this phone, and don't expect to game on it.",0
I noticed this screen has a tendency to pick up glare moreso than others so this should be taken into account when considering where a screen is to be placed.Build quality feels pretty amazing especially when compared to a much older and bulkier flat screen.,2
"It is just awful, but from talking and asking around all android like phones have this problem, so this may not be a problem at all just surprised how fast your battery goes down if your using it or not.",0
!,
"It has no frills its just a plain TV, I feel 3D, internet, smart TV blah blah feels gimmicky!",0
Another thing I really like is the swivel ability of the LCD screen.,2
The recommendation I received from Nikon is to open the battery & memory compartment to clear the condensation but you certainly do not want to do that under water or when the camera is wet.,1
This severely limits my capabilities to edit and manipulate these files (e.g.,0
"In some ways it is better, in some ways not so much.",1
The installation was easy and and so far so good.,2
"It doesn't generate any large amount of heat from the processor so you can place the laptop in sleep mode and leave it overnight without the worry of overheating.If you want to look cool in Starbucks then you should buy one of these, and if you want to do your work with little difficulty, then you should buy it.",2
Great deal!,2
"I was certain I'd be going for a Galaxy S4, but after reading numerous reviews and testing phones head-to-head in store, I went with the HTC One.",1
I have had many alarms of various makes over many years and none have so I am perfectly satisfied.People who complain about false alarms are using the wrong type in the wrong place.,2
I know there are other ways to get around this issue but for me I'm good with just logging into the current ip address assigned to my account and adding the port onto the end that I port forwarded.,1
"Then I learned that there actually is a difference among drives, and this Western Digital AV-GP WD10EURX one is designed for DVRs.",1
"So if you want ONLY the videos for channel 1, you can get that!",1
Save yourself a LOT of headache.,0
-7,
"My best guess is that the ""detect dark scenes and dim"" box is an ""exception"" rule that ships in ""off"" mode but somehow it shipped with the auto-dim turned on by accident.I'm re-rating it from one star to four, I would have given it a five if not for all the effort I had to put into it to get it to display how I wanted it look in the first place.Now that I know how to fix this issue, I'm getting the 32 inch Bravia for our bedroom!",1
Another high quality product from Amazon.com !,2
"As for the device, I Love It!",2
"And the other problem, an obvious money-grubbing device (Bad Olympus!",0
I just bought the Panny 55ST30 from Amazon.,1
"How very disappointed when, 4 days into his trip the camera 'went dead.'",0
iPad isn't.,1
Would recommend to anyone.,2
"From the unboxing, the installation was simple enough and light enough to carry myself to mount it.",2
pictures.,1
As they are LCD based systems they are inferior to the plasmas of Panasonic and Samsung because of the much lower refresh rates.,0
"Beautiful, fast, fantastic gorilla-glass screen.",2
"If I could give this less than one star, I would.",0
":-)  So, yes I recommend buying this product.",2
")I'm actually thinking of having a battery transplant done to this tablet.Also, I had a question e-mailed to me about the date and time display on this tablet.",1
"The video daytime is great, not perfect, not $1000 camera resolution, but good enough for sure.",2
It's extremely bright to the point of calling it slight oversaturation.,0
"They are not really known for their LCD/LED TV's; you think of Panasonic you think Plasma.I needed a 50"" TV for a little as money as possible that wasn't ugly.",1
"This is the worst camera out there as far as the battery life goes, I am on my second one because I returned the first one because the battery died after approximately 2 hours so returned it to get another one thinking that the first one was defective to find out the 2nd one was the same way with the battery life.",0
Even our Mac IT guru could not get it to work.,0
"While I wouldn't really call T-Mobile's call quality or coverage ""great"", I would definitely say that it has been ""good enough"" for me while living around Boston and San Francisco, and the price has certainly been reasonable.",1
I have never seen a company so dedicated to providing good customer service!,2
"My chief complaint with the Solstice was the calendar, it's bad enough that it doesn't sync directly with Outlook (it has its own proprietary calendar/contacts software that does that) but the real problem is that the file record limitations for the Solstice mean that you'll retain little more than the name of the appointment, the phone number or address and little else.The Blackjack has none of those limitations, which means that I can put an entire travel itinerary in an appointment file and easily retrieve flight numbers and references without the fear of the text ending early.I like the keyboard, it's great for texting.",2
"If you have trouble seeing small keys, this phone is what you need.",2
"Though I don't consider myself a ""Sharp person"" (no pun intended), Sharp has been a great experience for us.4) My biggest concern about purchasing a 70"" HDTV is MPG compression, and the distance we sit from the TV.",1
"Speaking about just the camera here, it is ridiculously easy to use, very intuitive, a well thought out design, well balanced, with enough heft, yet light enough for all that it offers.",2
Perfect fit for everyday use access to amazon prime a plus.,2
"I've used the 3D a few times, love it.",2
I would recommend this TV.,2
I had my iphone 4 for 2 years and treated it really well.,1
"For example, if you press 13, you will go to the digital channel 13-1, not the analog channel 13.",1
Definitely worth it.,2
"I had 4-5 remotes, tv, cable, soundbar, Dlink, DVD.",1
Usually I end up doing a little color correction on my digital photos but I will hardly have to touch the over 100 shots I took.,2
"The phone was sent with a dull battery, and was a complete mess otherwise.",0
!,
Only problem was the tripod broke on set up and the flash is of low quality.,0
Only use game mode when playing online multiplayer.,1
This lets me enjoy the built in smart TV features of the Samsung TV...,2
They replaced the panel with a new one... no more green line.,1
"It's a little harder to hold while zooming than any other camera I had, but the touch screen is fabulous for searching through pictures and finding the settings you want for your picture.",2
"She said ""I think so"" and I proceeded to attempt to configure the tv's wi fi connection to the internet.I go into the TV network settings and locate my Verizon FIOS wi fi router, enter the security key and the TV connects to the router but can't get an IP address.",1
Heavy enough to really seem well built without seeming clunky.Cons:1.,1
"It's *not* *that* *hard*.I'll give props to the local service company, Gibson TV, in Roseville Michigan.",1
Though it is not near as bad as buying at a store (Retail 1899 * our 10% tax  = $470 in savings!),1
I have talked to him about it a bit and he seems quite happy with it over all.,2
"DSC-H5 has 3"" bright higher resolution LCD.",1
I looked at the Sony 40XBR7 and as far as I am concerned there is no difference except a lower price on the 40XBR6.,2
"And for $69, this phone is such a satisfaction.",2
I love it!,2
I see they have made the processor dual core in the newer models.I've had this TV for over a year now and I love it.,2
The further the distance the worst the quality.,0
"Two very minor things: (a) when closed, the bottom sticks out a millimeter more than the lid, so it's a bit difficult to open the lid all the way with one hand; and (b) there is a thin plastic horizontal line that runs along the bottom facing you that sticks out - maybe not sharp enough to do any damage, but it's still annoying.As for Chrome OS, I'm so relieved not to have to deal with bloatware/software or managing processes.",1
The slightest bit off causes it not to work.,0
That and it uses AA cells.,1
"First was the monitor started going off for no reason in the middle of the night saying ""out of range"", then the power cord stopped working, so we called customer service.",0
"Like many, I first looked at all of the many cool-factor lightweight LCD's.",1
I bought it for a gift for my daughter for Christmas.,1
"Browsing is a lot easier in desktop mode, with links appearing just the right size.",2
"I did a lot of research on LCD tvs with the following criteria: Under $1000, 46-52"" and 1080/120.",1
"I had to figure out where the buttons are but really like the style.Easy to use, easy to read, great colors and graphics.",2
And Nokia making it fixed focus...I really don't see the rational as all of their previous 3.2mps have auto focus.,0
Fantastic phone!,2
Connects to the internet through my router faster than my computer or Kindle does.,2
I bought this for my mother.,1
It is an excellent TV/Monitor I use it as a computer monitor and it is great at an awesome price.,2
"The size, weight and feel of the camera is top notch.",2
This product was perfect.,2
"Just recently we opened our bedroom windows and one strong breeze was all it took to tip our TV completely off the stand resulting in a cracked screen, visio wont repair or exchange the TV now even with our extra warranty and to add insult to injury their operator was really quite rude.",0
The particular model I received was Revision 1 so no external drive capability.,1
Please use the settings below for best picture settings.,1
My dad too it on a cruise to the Bahamas and got some really great pictures.,2
"Works great, picture is amazing.",2
3,
I have had it for a few weeks now and I can say I'm really happy with my purchase.,2
"I figured not removing the card would help to protect it from wear and tear.Good luck with your camera.Tim, Ohio",1
I will have to purchase an additional speaker system for this TV.,1
Also the ability to take a piture in a dark place appears bright when displayed amazes me.,2
Once the screen acted up it was time to search for a new one.,0
It works great not sure if I can add any app to it but it works good for a phone so I can call and text my government phone wouldn't allow me to get or receive any text so I'm happy with this phone.,2
I took my T3i on the beach last week to get some shots.,1
"With finger swipes you can view new photos, even draw on photos using your finger or the included stylus.",2
"Of course, the problem isn't fixed.Now I have to go back through their online system, 3 days go by, nobody calls me, so I call them.",0
Finally this camera repreents a major move for Fuji.,2
But already knew when I purchased the tv I wasn't going to use the remote being I have a all in one remote that I love...hope the reviewed help,1
"The touchscreen works perfect and many people say it shuts off by itself, i have not had 1 problem with this phonw",2
This matter may be trivial to many viewers.,1
"I threw a lot of material at it, and I can only remember seeing one scene where it was kind of choppy.",1
I got this security camera to see what was going on and maybe get an idea of who was doing these things.,1
The photos are a great quality.,2
"The 20D has been discontinued as far as I know but you can still find them new on ebay etc., given a choice go for the 30D, they've revamped the shutter mechanism, revamped at least one of the focusing modes, the lcd is bigger and brighter, and to me anyhow, it just feels a lot spunkier when I shoot with it (and the 20D was already incredibly spunky).",0
Right now you will need to purchase the Canon Lens Adapter for another 120.,1
This solved that!,1
"I walked to the side about 50 yds, and when focussed again on the distant dot, realised that his head had turned, and he was still watching me.",1
"Between the Vizio representative and my DISH representative,  I spend nearly two hours to get the unit to work.However,  it's working well now,  and is quite a buy for the money.Perhaps I should change the  ""I like it""  to  ""I love it"" !",2
"I've never heard of it, but it actually turned out to be really nice.PRO's & CON'sPROS:+Really nice picture quality (1080p)+Quick responsiveness on the remote control+1 Year guarantee+Thin bezels+Volume gets really highCONS:-Remote is ""basic"" - not like one you would get w/ Samsung but it gets the job done-Interface (Menu) - not as pretty as a Samsung's-Service-only USB port; but it DOES work w/ Google ChromecastSummary:I was looking to just get a big screen TV with 1080p picture, and that's what it is.",2
It does want you to create a mydlink account during the setup.,1
Fully Impressed With the ruggedness of this phone!,2
Wanted an easy to use camera with a lot of zoom and small enough to fit in my motorcycle side bag.,2
I found the EM5 difficult to hold comfortably as there's no grip.Panasonic G6:  The G6 produces files of the same resolution as the NEX-6 but its sensor produces more noise and RAW images do not provide as much highlight/shadow recovery as the NEX-6.,0
"There were two instruction manuals enclosed in the box (the only enclosures in the box) for both the Coby TV, and one for a Sharp LCD TV.To date, our inquiries regarding this TV have netted us nothing but an automated email saying someone was out of their office until October 1.i would not recommend this TV to anyone since I believe most people who purchase a TV plan to watch it.",0
!,
You get great specs for a great price that is significantly below what other manufacturers charge.I give the TV a big thumbs up--4 stars--with the remote control being the only flaw that prevents a 5 star rating.,2
When I mean hot I don't mean extremely hot but you can tell the difference.,1
"there is some distance between our bed and the media table, about 5 meters, so we were not sure if this size would be appropriate, but it's perfect.",2
Camera body size is similar although the EM5 feels much more like an old film camera (with it's SLR-like body design).,1
"Megapixles aren't everything and where the L620 lacks, this camera heavily succeeds and should not be over looked!The screen: the screen isn't super good or anything, it shows the pictures you took in somewhat good detail.",2
It is a great choice for those who want more than a regular point-and-shoot but doesn't need/cannot afford an SLR.,2
This was minor at best and it wasn't a tablet-breaking experience.,1
Many of of MKV and MP4 video files do not play using the Samsung USB interface.,0
"Looking at the rear screen, press DISP repeatedly until you get a screen that shows various shooting parameters.",1
"to get things to work to there full potential, like mms.",1
(try Amazon's Prime video and movie service to see what I mean - maybe if Amazon would create an app for ....),1
I've timed it and it can be a delay of up to 10 seconds.,1
I'm returning it and very annoyed to have been misled by their advertising.,0
I did so again.,1
This was replacing a 55 inch Sony Bravia LCD I purchased about 6 year ago...,1
Too many to list here.,1
"Initially, however, the first few minutes of fiddling around with the tablet, the battery was dying by the minute.",0
"Sony claims in-writing, on their website, that their manufacturing process allows for a certain number of burnt-out or ""stuck"" pixels, and it is normal for them.",1
Is it an Ipad?,1
The 120HZ feature though is not much helpful.,0
Movie mode worked good but was dissappointed that I could not easily put them on a DVD without buying a little white box that Amazon also sells.,0
"That being said, subject matter in low light must not be moving or there will be motion blur.",1
"Difficult at first to use if you're not familiar withthis type of QWERTY keypad.Calling: A tad annoying at first, but once you have learned the process(took me a couple of times) its EASY.",1
It works quite nicely.,2
"), it froze up and would not work.",0
No surprises or problems.,1
I am very pleased with this package and my wife and family photographer is tickled pink with this package.,2
"On AnTuTu Benchmark it had a 13588 score, good rating & ranked #11 on the bar chart behind the Google Nexus 4 & right before the Samsung Galaxy S2.",1
"For a cell-phone not ordinarily sold in the States, the LG KP500 Cookie is most practical, especially after inserting an eight-gigabyte microSD memory chip.",2
"It has plenty of storage for video, books and apps when I am out of Wi Fi range and when using wi-fi it is very quick on loading web pages, downloads of various media, and I can watch Hulu, Netflix, etc with impunity.",2
I've read the blogs for months.,1
I traded my I-phone for this one and I'm so glad I did.,2
Excellent.,2
When it arrived it was not working.,0
This TV is just plain beautiful...  No other words to describe it...,2
needs a little investment of time and efforts initially to get familiar with the functions which could be little tedious but if you travel internationally this is really good value for money !,1
As a con I have to mention that it doesn't have audio out (at least the one we have doesn't).,0
I should have just bought a new one.,0
I don't know a whole lot about this item specifically as it was purchased as a gift for my father.,1
It's a good tv for the price.,2
El mejor cel del mundo.,
It works fine but it does not support a lot of apps or other stuff that I need on a daily basis.,0
"It probably looks like I both love and hate this TV, NO I love this TV and we wouldn't trade it..",2
I haven't seen or heard anyone mention the touch screen feature on his camera.,1
That's what I've come to expect from Amazon.,1
The Weather Sealing is much better for the shooting I do.,2
Does it deserve 5 stars?,1
It is the best way to learn.,1
Using an indirect flash weakens the intensity more so.,1
Don't need an iphone to do what I need.,1
!,
The Kodak Sport C135 is truly rugged since I dropped it to no ill effect.,2
I highly recommend this camera.,2
This phone lagged so much it was virtually impossible to even navigate my self through the phone.,0
The price was really good and didn't involve a lot a un-necessary packaging.,2
After comparing features and battery life this model suited me best.,2
It allows faster image capture.,2
they told me the distance from the tv to the router had to be 25 feet or less.,1
"and ability to take some decent videos as well (mine doesn't make weird sound, just make sure you have some ambient sound.",1
"I can say, at the proper distance, there's no issue with motion flicker - if you are too close you see the trails and object jump.",1
"I just got this laptop today and I've found a USB port that won't accept a cable, the laptop won't shutdown properly, the Dell software fights the Windows software, and it won't update to Windows 8.1.",0
Glad I don't text much.,1
I am so glad that I went with this camera.,2
Wider zoom range 5X versus 3.8X.,1

Yes the reflective nature of the panel is a bit of a downer if light is an issue.,0
It's quite glossy and our lamps reflect off of the TV quite noticeably.,0
Luckily you can find any answer through Google.,1
This was something I wasn't aware of when I bought the set and it was a nice surprise.Update 11/2012 - Still very pleased with the TV.,2

I really thought I was the only one.,1
"The files will be listed as time stamped names on the thumb drive and easily browsable and playable in Windows.You can not do this with the US411ZS DVR from US Security Solutions at all, ever.",1
"During usage, I noticed that the pictures I have taken were either soft or out of focus.",0
It would have been nice to have a yellow/ red /white input.,1
"You can't have it all, can you?I strongly recommend it!",2
"Both have a touch pad on the keyboard, so you need no mouse or the mouse arrow on the remote.Google TV;  There is obviously lots to learn about Google TV that I don't know.",1
Got no problem with it,2
"Phone met my expectations very much.Only one hitch -  guide booklet was not in English, so I have had to learn hands-on.",1
"But I can say right now that I will never, ever buy another Emerson product.",0
"service said you need web cam for that not a secutity camera, well I have 2 Foscam cameras and they are live on my web site to I can watch them anywhere in the world that has internet access.",1
I think that's normal because I see it on a couple other LG HDTVs as well.,1
I'd like to hit play and the tv show runs until it is over.,1
I bought this monitor for our first born a little over a year ago after a lot of research.,1
"Even when she manages to download a picture, the quality is awful.",0

"If you have pets, they might freak out.- Could be a little sturdier.",0
Will update this review upon resolution of my service request.,1
I received the camera a day after the order was placed.,2
The system works very well and i would highly endorse it.,2
Was looking for a user-friendly camera that takes quality pictures.,1
Everything on this machine works seamlessly and easily.,2
"Fast (we have 4, 3, and 2 week old daughters, and we haven't really missed a shot that we likely would have missed with the S3), intelligent (the EXR calculations on portraits, long field of focus, low light, intelligent flash, to name a few), and easy (the interface, ""auto"" modes when you want them and manual modes when you need them).My only gripe is not being able to remove face detection during auto EXR mode, which delays shots...this could entirely be my not getting a setting, but I've looked pretty extensively and haven't figured it out.Otherwise, for the money, this is among the best cameras I've ever owned.",2
"Get a CRT while you still can, because they are being phased out for the lower quality LCD.",1
"the sound was really weak at first but after tweaking it a little, its better than my old tv.",2
"We run Office 365 where I work and integration with Exchange is a breeze, email and calendars work great.",2
"This camera puts forth such great, quality photos in auto mode that I usually do not have to do much editing to get a great picture to share.4) Takes great low light photos- I rarely use the flash with this camera.",2
"Very pixelated and has terrible night vision, you can't make out faces with it even at a very close range (within 5 to 10 feet).",0
"I'm aware this might be more of a problem on our behalf than a flaw with the camera itself, but what can I say, the whole experience is what counts.",1
"Brightness is dimmer by default (due to aggressive battery saving settings), but enabling Medium brightness on the Focus S is brighter than the Focus in default.Overall I'm very happy with my upgrade, and extremely happy with the phone overall.",2
If your phone number is not correct in amazon preferences you will have a lot of problems.,0
However it turns out that the unit I received had a problem with the HDMI ports.,0
What is this China?,1
I used these for my snorkeling shots.,1
"Even with the zoom fully extended, the sunny outdoor pictures were really nice.",2
We tried new battery- nothing.,0
Now I have to go out and look for the extender that will fit into the camera to use.,0
Does everything for which we were considering getting the next step up.,2
You need to get a Smart TV like the LG Electronics 42LA6200 42-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses.,1
"When this happens with the HDX, it always works fine on my iphone.",1
If it wasn't for these issues it would be a great phone because everything else works fine.,0
"It has functions, for snow, pets, sports, night time portraits, plus hundreds more.",2
False alarms on windy days.Good product for $20.,2
Has standard mounting holes on the back so easy to mount on wall mount.,2
The Denon was a better deal.,0
Adds a nice modern look to my bedroom.,2
"My voice is in no way unusual, with a common Midwest accent.",1
Connecting to the wireless network took a couple tries but was not overly complex.I have had it up and running for several weeks now.The software to keep it doing what I want (viewing an area and reporting an alarm when there is activity) is not easy to configure.,0
Just like the book said:  A rainy day really makes the colors jump out.,1
I keep having to turn the TV on and off just to see a 30 min show.,0
"Its density of pixels falls below the HTC 8X, but instead offers a slightly larger screen coming up to 4.5 inches.",1
"Immediately I could tell that something was wrong and opened one of the service doors to find that the mirror was shattered into 1,000 pieces.",0
"But this one didnt last but 1 year, could just be that 1 isolated physical camera.",0
"It was only allowing me to select language and displaying a notice that read ""emergency calls only"", so i contacted the sellers who told me that they will refund me because they sent a defective phone.",0
"In the store, it passed my eyeball test.",2
HELP.,0
TV arrived in 4 days and delivery was very professional.Picture looks fantastic (Blu-ray just blows me away) and the TV looks great on the wall when not on.,2
"I Plug it into my computer and within 2 Minutes I was able to configure it to my Wireless Network, Once I tested the camera on my home Network and made sure it operated fine.I switched it over to the TMOBILE Hotspot.",2
You can plug in the HDMI cable to your laptop and see your media content.Also netflix and the rest of the smart contents works perfectly.,2
"Totally useless, as there are already LED lights on the laptop that show this.",0
"So, if you're specifically looking for a wireless device, this may not do the job.The other feature I disliked was that when the screen was set up to auto-dim based on ambient light, it was almost always FAR too dim.",0
Its an ok for but you get what you paid for.,1
"Otherwise, it's great!",2
"If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this.",2
"If the seals fail, your camera is toast.",1
I am not a techie and tend to be intimidated by gadgets.,1
Highly recommended.,2
No complaints with the camera and most accessories.,2
"Almost none of the resulting photos stands up to scrutiny: details are blurry, colors in people's faces washed out.",0

I find it distracting to be on 'Standard' when watching dramas.,1
I especially like this feature because I can rip all the kids movies onto the hard drive and I don't have to worry about them breaking the DVD player or scratching up the disks.,2
It was my primary reason for buying this.,1
delivery was prompt.,2
Thank you so much!,2

The LCD view finder on the SX 50 is much better as you can pop it out & twist it to see it better.,1
HOLY S*** !!!,1
"Otherwise, I was happy with the picture, but these other issues seemed to overshadow my initial experience with this set.UPDATE August 21, 2011 - Posted a couple videos to YouTube showing one of the most major problems with this set, after returning the first & second sets, only to get this one with similar problems.[...]",0
"No, it isn't a smart phone, but it has many of the features found on phones that cost much more.",2
Here are some points more specific to this camera:1.,1
"The one I owned previously got stolen from me in the chesapeake, va area.",1
In easy/simple mode the camera self-selects from among six of the 18 scene options.,2
I previously had the HTC EVO 3D which was a deplorable piece of shit imo.,0
"no offers to extend warranty, just an offer to send out a service person to ""fix"" the problem.",0
You will pull your hair out as it freezes during phone calls and texts because it's not built to handle the good graphics of the android OS.,0
He had everything up and running in no time.,2
Works GREAT.This Phone IS: awesome.,2
I have owned this camera for 7 months now and I dislike it more and more as I get my processed film back.,0
!,
"e.g., Infrared for wireless remotes, GPS etc.",1
Camera stops working frequently.,0
Overall a great TV.,2
The only thing that I wished it had was more memory on it.,0
Early reviews will not reflect this.,1
very cheap and really a good tv set.,2
"She does not use a computer, and probably never will even try, even though she does express interest at times in doing so.",0
"But, in comparison the quality of the TV picture quality really shine which makes the additional cost worth it.",2
It is better than GPS tester and seems to help the phone connect to the GPS signal faster also I'm now using the GPS app Waze...wow Great GPS to Traveling...Try it!UPDATE: August 2012 all the above still stands.,2
"This tablet is a good deal for the price, initially was looking for one under $100 but wasn't excited about anything i found in terms of specs and the reviews were no help either.",1
Surfing the web was not a desk and chair activity involving a little computer monitor.,1
I like it better the LG remote except no keyboard option for youtube app.- in-build speakers are loud enough so don;t need external one.- and so many things but don;t have time to write here.cons:- no qwerty keyboard available so it's hard to type something with magic remote.- Worst youtube app I have ever seen on this TV like: 1)alpha-bates not arranged like normal keyboard so hard to type.,0
The picture will blow you away.,2
"Netflix, Amazon Prime, Skype, Facebook apps all preloaded.",2
A big concern for me was picture clarity.,0
"), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S5.",2
"I purchased the Disney ""WOW"" Blu ray TV(Plasma, LCD) and stereo set up disc.",1
I am a novice photographer and I found it easy to use.,2
"Sony is notorious for this across all lines of their products, and they even admit in-writing this is acceptable to them.",0
"Guy ""Mikey"" about this, but I still went and bought it from Costco.",1
"Also, unlike the S series classy flat black matte finish, this M model has the ""Samsungy"" glossy piano black finish.",0
It allows me to keep track of my pets when at work and the house and property when traveling.,2
"I could hear something rattling around inside, but the actual viewfinder looked normal until you looked THROUGH it.",0
"They say it's very low power, but I'm not sure the exact watts.11)  We mounted the HDTV into the mortar over our fireplace with a VideoSecu Tilt TV Wall Mount kit from Amazon.",1
"Connected to an A/V tuner/receiver, we can now provide Apple devices with a convenient way to reach the projector.",2
This leads me to another plus.,2
I opted in to be a BETA tester for this product when it was first intoduced several years ago.,1
The lag time from the time you push the button to the time it takes a photo makes it almost impossible to take action shots.,0
"I had no illusions that this Pentax would provide the best photos I had ever seen, I just wanted to take it in the water.",1
The phone was still under someone name who still had payments due so I couldn't use it.,0
I got stuck in Netflix.,0
That is also a sore spot for me because this phone was released August 2010 and its still running the same old software.,0
only had it 2 weeks.. hard drive died.. cameras are blurry.. system keeps shutting itself on/off would not recommend buying.,0
"Just a few more of the features I love already: AE (auto exposure) lock, auto bracketing, 25-shot stop action images, ability to shoot in TIFF and RAW modes (RAW mode is available through a hidden menu), autofocus area controls, metering modes, and the help icons.It doesn't have the greatest movie mode, but making movies isn't the reason I bought a digital camera - I would've gotten a camcorder instead.Many people think the design is ugly, but personally, I love the sturdy, industrial design.",2
Not a video cam.,0
Some of the other waterproof cameras shoot HD video which would eat up memory really fast but they take the normal miniSD or whatever.,1
"I found the exact same computer on Amazon, purchased it, had it in 3 days and it took me 15 minutes to unpack, change hard drives and I was back up and running.Great experience all around.",2
"The remote it came with does not have that feature and the TV does not have the slim, sleek lines as the 60"".",0
I recently bought this TV from Walmart.,1
"I like the product, but beware you need to configure your router.",1
"Unfortunately, it's not working for me.",0
When I switched to IE the sound came through.,1
It is not fooled by pictures of faces.,1
"En pocas palabras puedo decir que es el mejor smartphone del 2011, la camara el lo máximo ademas graba video el full hd la pantalla tiene colores muy vivos en fin la cantidad de funciones que posee esta version el very good.",
I had to install an internet wired LAN for the Internet services to be excellent.,1
Too bad the company won't stand behind it.--,0
Overall a good point and shoot when you don't want to lug around a DSLR.,2
"It makes me think kindly of party line telephones, hand ringers, smoke signals, and homing pidgeons!",2
"All of it looks beautiful.I did get the extended warranty plan just for piece of mind, knowing a few people who have had to use them.",2
Look great and TVE hardware is excelent.,2
This camera produces quality clear photos.,2
"Similar thing happened in subsequent battery chargings but it is always resolved like above, so it looks like loose connection somewhere on the path which is easily fixable.In summary, if you need a relatively cheap and tough camera (i.e.",1
"Texting is easy, the display is great and easy to see.",2
"after a while i noticed light and dark spots on the screen this can be seen when changing a channel when the picture is black.and now after a year and a half we have a red line going down on the left side it is hard to see most of the time but i know it's still there & it should not be.you should not have to pay $2,200.00 for a tv and not have it working properly.we did not buy a warranty & we should have but now it's too late.",0
I spoke with someone who could not assist me.,0
She did have another cell phone before I got her this one so she does know the basics of how to use one.,1
I was not pleased by how the camera was packaged.,0
Set-up starts when you turn it on for the first time.,1
"Sound is low , would recommend connecting it to a home theater to enjoy the experience to the fullest.",1
I purchased a Panasonic for half of what I paid for this.,1

Music sound was great.,2
"While some of the features of the Bold are not on the Q10, I still love it!",2
It doesn't last a  work day without being depleted - and I don't really use it that much.,0
I was surprised when it delivered to my home.Becasuse it has many function for viewer.,2
That being said this might be the cream of the crop when it comes to TVs.,2
It had great range.,2
So sad to see it go back.,0
"However, even the most recent sophisticated Smart Phones do not have the true capabilities of a ""good"" P&S; Camera, just as a good P&S; Camera does not have the true capabilities of a DSLR or SLT Camera.",1
The software with that comes with the camera is sufficient with the stitching software proving to be quite capable.,2
I have this model and the model before this one and they are awesome camera!,2
"So yes, it has his seal of approval.",2
"Owners should also be aware that unless one owns a newer computer with a current-generation video card, playback of HD video will be choppy if not impossible.All in all, I would say this camera is a great value for the money.",2
Nice specs and wide enough screen.,2
The external controls make the camera a pleasure to use.,2
"Now on to the screen’s you can watch a movie or you tube ect on the touch side it’s a nice clear picture of course with only 4 gigs of ram and a underpowered processor along with the integrated Intel video card you get pretty much what you would expect, and for the inner side screen in laptop mode it’s just plain bad it has some kind of coating on it that makes everything look almost milky it’s good for word-processing and other business apps in fact it’s the only way you can use most apps, even with apps that have touch support they don’t work right with Taichi’s touch so get used to laptop mode for work but you will also have to get an external mouse the touchpad on this thing will drive you insane they tried to make the touchpad like it was a touchscreen and it didn’t work out pinch and zoom and Asus’s own shortcut’s via touchpad are enough to make you want a refund but you can tweak it and get some use but hey no big deal most laptop touch’s suck.",0
You would have never thought it was refurbished.,2
"Pictures easy to view under ""fun settings""Favorites: u have a favorites list for contacts, one for apps other things (i.e.",1
"The others were either unavailable,  or too pricy.Set-up was a breeze,  however,  to get it to work was something else.",1
That would be another minor ding on the score.,0
Audio is a bit low for the movies in play back on a computer though.,0
I have 6M DSL service which tends to be more in the 4M realm.,1
We just bought the S90 from Costco but now we see S90Canon PowerShot S90IS 10MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-inch LCDIS being sold on Amazon.,1
Sew-on belt loop and detachable shoulder strap.,1
The pictures are sharp and clear and a person could be easily identified if caught on the cameras.,2
NOW!,
I am new to dslr's but so far I am loving the camera.,2
"Haven't tried out the ""waterproof-ness"" yet but it seems to be sealed really well with the battery and USB card all in one place.",2
Very nice product.,2
"After owning it for less than two weeks, it stopped working.",0
BUYER BEWARE.I am currently wrestling with Toshiba's warranty and service department.,0
It is a simple point and shoot that will take pictures with a nice resolution.,2
I was surprised to find them in an untouched condition.,2
There is no way to block unwanted numbers and no reject list for messaging or calls.,0
"I noticed a different experience between the 40"" and 46"".",0
I can only assume that the previous owners decided to get a TV with a larger screen because this one is working perfectly.,2
"Fortunately, unlike other sets in this price range, the LG has an ethernet input.",2
This is a one great TV.,2
My complain is that it is slower online to load maps than iPhone's Google Map.,0
"However, since I didn't read many amazon reviews directed at the true photography amateur, I thought I would provide an amateur's perspective in this review.",1
Phone was perfect until 3 weeks in.,0
"I had it now for a few months, and taken plenty of photos.",2
Came in box damaged after I spent 2 hours mounting and setting it up...,0
I've owned about 20 macs and needed something cheap and simple for a new employee to lug around.,1
Awesome.,2
We perhaps should have stuck with Samsung?,0
Eventually I received a phone number assignment but was unable to get the service to recognize the number.Phone will go into the trash.,0
"In the SD500' defense it does look and feel better than the Fuji and uses the cheap SD cards.6) Finally a good movie mode (at 640 x 480 and very crisp 30 fps)Here are the CONS1) Uses those pesky xD cards which are harder to find, more expensive and smaller capacities than the SD cards.2) No optical viewfinder.",0
Plop down a few hundred extra dollars and get the Harmony One remote (but the other harmonies are all crap).,0
Wrong.Depot shipped back my laptop and said that the issue was at Hard Drive.,0
No problems accept I can't get the stupid turn on/off sound to stop.,0
"I really enjoy my camera, I think the canon glass is generally overpriced especially for the professional L series lenses.",0
Sharp should be clear on this point.,0
I found an on-line coupon for a free alarm panel and that sealed the deal.,2
I would strongly suggest buying a car charger and an extra wall or PC charger.,1
"Probably only about 1:1 macro (in old 35mm terms) but able to get photo of half a paper staple, and the damage on the staple and the paper from the action of fitting.So, recommend?",1

The zooom is wonderful and the pictures are awesome.,2

"The descriptions says ""Front of housing has minor cosmetic imperfection"".",0
Had a case on it and everything.,1

iTunes sharing couldn't be easier.,2
"He uses the 70-200mm, f2.8 lens.",1
"It does a good job of upscaling standard def media as well.Cons:  If I sit off center by 50  degrees, the color starts to wash out.",0

I purchased this phone in hopes of thinking this phone was going to be like or close to similarities of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 but it didn't.,0
"bought 2, one the touch screen did not work, other one has its own quirks.",0
Not sure it did because of a feature.,2
I feel like I'm shooting target practice trying to get even a delayed response from the TV.,0
"The pictures rendered, and the bright, 3"" LCD screen on the back of the camera makes it wonderful to use.",2
Shoots video.,1
"Not into 3-D, so I can't comment.",1
It doesn't bother me at all because I know at the end of the day I will capture the most memorable shots.,2
I couldn't take any pictures of a large group of trees and be satisfied with it.,0
This problem is all the more serious because the camera also lacks the customary built in flaps that cover the lens when you turn it off.,0
"For this price point I can't find anything, where the Galaxy S-III falls short.",0
"takes great pics, has lots of options and isn't big and heavy but still enough to hold onto.",2
"I called support once I found out it costs and they were of no help.Shame on Verizon, perhaps I should have stuck with AT&T; and my Lumia 920.",0
"If the Roku stick is left in the MHL port, you have to push the input button on the remote and scroll down to the MHL input, which would possibly be even more confusing.",0
"I'm investigating how to fix this, any ideas?",1
"I've had this TV for about 2 months now, and I'm very happy with it.",2
Overall just a better device love everything about it!!,2
Less than $1300 for this TV and a bluray player that sold easily for $200.,1
I love them all.,2
"May be I have a defective unit.Asked Amazon to return the unit, but amazon policy is:""Amazon.com cannot accept the return of televisions 27 inches and larger after delivery.",0
Very happy with it.Haven't used the 2nd sims card yet but will use it in London soon.,2
Random power-off/power-on3.,0
What a great product.,2
I am getting further into its features now that I'm back from my trip.,1
"I did not have time to properly learn about all the features, but I am very happy with the camera and everyone who sees it is impressed.",2
"Since then, I toted this in a jacket pocket and the 15 cent cover over the lense got bent.",0
I purchased it for my 5 year old grandson to download learning games and he just loves it.,2
The remote has an interesting design and works well for many tasks.,2
Who needs a smart phone w/all the extra fees you'll have to pay the phone company.,0
"My Aunt's 4 year old 37 inch Samsung has speakers on the sides too, they sound epic!",2
"The Nikon Coolpix L610 is what I would call a ""best value"" travel-zoom camera with a strong lens, a decent selection of scene modes and accurate color representation.",2
I think that cheaper feeling plastic is the key to the light weight of the laptop though.,1
"The picture, sound and the quick delivery before Christmas met all of our expectations.",2
"I got this camera because of 1) the low light/high ISO capabilities 2) I couldn't afford to get the F31FD or F30, they are rare to find and go for +$300.",2
"Slightly improved ergonomics with thumb rest and slightly rougher texture on the surface, allowing a better grasp.",2
I enjoy it every day.,2
"As of right now, I cannot say that I will consider them again.",0
"The Lumia 920 was an awesome phone, the only issue was I had poor LTE service at my house.",1
I know this is because they want you to buy rinetones but they should at least have one ringtone that sounds like something ringing.,1
I ordered this in 55-inch right before the Super Bowl and I wanted to reserve judgment for a few weeks to view the TV in many different ways.,1
LENS ERROR .,0
I am now on Generation 2 with a total of 4 cameras.,1
"I work in the woods...laying out, building, and maintaing all kinds of trails: hikig, skiing, snowmobile and mountain bike trails.",1
Excellent and expanded image stabilization.,2
"One slight problem is that when I turn the sound all the way up I can hear the router multiplexing, but this is probably because I'm using B/G network mode rather than the later N mode.",0
I try numerous times but the TV is unable to obtain an IP address from the router.,0
I think the faster processor makes a difference in game load times and browser speed - I am able to view websites in Desktop mode and it performs very well.,2
Now I am left to deal with the manufactures warranty lets see where that gets me.,0
"It is quick to change ISO and white balance (including preset white balance and white balance fine tuning) and flash exposure compensation and flash mode, all without using menus.",2
"She probably won't use the Smart features, but they are there if she wants them.",1
There were many times as well that a vehicle with radar would be directly in my view but the radar would not go off.,0
The possibilities are endless with this amazing device.,2
"This is my 1st tablet, I uses it mostly for surfing with Chrome browser, Video watching with YouTube and Netflix, Video calling with Skype, playing game, and reading eBooks.",1
"What light, I asked.",1
Nothing to envy from my Samsung's LCD in similiar size...,1
Great product.,2
There was a sticker in the back of the phone.,1
"After having about 700 shots printed on paper (4 x 6, 5 x 7 and 8 x 10's) - I can't tell the difference between film and digital.",1
Its great.,2
The TV upscales to 1080 and the TV I ordered Samsung UN32EH5000 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV (Black) was giving me headaches from eyestrain because the inability to focus.,0
The card size kinda maxes out at 2 gigs (that's all that's available for sale although tech specs say it can go higher) which is fine since the cam doesn't shoot HD video.,1
What can I say.,1
***************I want to know what exactly difference between this TV and 47LM6700 model because that is much cheaper than this one?,1
"Camera:I have owned this camera practically since it came out on the market, and at the time it looked like an expensive proposition, especially when compared to Nikon D50, Canon Rebel XT, or an used 20D.",1
Otherwise they may just dropoff the product at your building.,1
Cant sign into emails like my 22 dollar lg revere.,1
!,
She loves it.,2
"No buzzing noted,unless you go around to the back of the set and put your ear six (6)inches from the panel.",1
But the reality of my own particular situation is that calling has become secondary to internet/email and texting as far as smartphone communication goes.,1
The only complaint that I have is that it is very heavy.,0
"(2) when you adjust the picture mode such as vivid, custom, standard, cinema etc., I chose the vivid mode when I exit from adjustment it always go back to custom mode.",1
"However, that is not a real issue.",1
I researched many different tablets and when I saw the Wolvol I will say I was a little unsure but then I saw a demo about it on Youtube and it had everything I wanted.,1
(The nice thing about exposure compensation on this camera is that it remains locked in until you change it.,2
"When the LCD preview image and the lens simultaneously stuck with the batteries fully exhausted a few minutes later, I realized that a half-battery icon essentially means that it is time to change out the batteries on the spot (the icon really ought to be more specific).Image quality can range from okay (somewhat overexposed) to outstanding depending on the light, taking the time to pre-focus and the steadiness of one's hand.",1
Terrible product!!!,0
"Remember, this is a camera first.",1
"As far as point and shoots go, this one is okay, its easy to use, its light weight, and the price is not to bad.",2
"On the other hand, a person who purchases a $200 Comet and spends about $20 a month on average in prepaid minutes and web access is going to spend about $700 over that same period.",1
I've upped the rating to 5 stars.,2
"I didn't have to go to the store, put it in my car & take it into my home.",1
"So far, it's been working just fine and we're happy with it.",2
"Overall, the TV is nice looking and the picture quality is awesome, but, the sound system COMPLETELY SUCKS.",0
"(don't worry, it's still going to be bright) and downloaded an app called ""Night Mode"" which helped the battery life.",1
It still works but you cant see anything on the screen which makes it pointless.,0
My only other complaint is that I can never get the flash to stay on the camera for long as it falls off easily.,0
"I hope they will improve on this area, since I really love the Sony picture quality.",0
Easy to assemble and program.,1
"Surely its design is the least attractive of the three, but that can be a strength that will help convince users like me who prefer a more sober style on their phones.I hope to help you in your decision with this modest analysis.",0
The sound has far more impact than the image itself and it amazes me people buy large flat screen TV's and still use the built in speakers which can't even come close to portraying the entire frequency range.,0
"I don't watch movies on my smartphone, but I'm nonetheless impressed with the picture quality.- Surprisingly good battery life!",2
I am not too tech savvy.,0
"Works well but of you drop the handset, look out.",1
".because it is just over the 90 day warranty, they will send me a box to send it to them for the wonderfully low price of 70.00.",2
I can't say enough great things about this camera.,2
The Television is exactly what I wanted and received it is now in my room where I can see clear picture of shows and games like NFL and Soccer,2
She didn't make me do a million things to try and prove to her over the phone that it was defective.,0
Not a big deal but I don't like to have to think about these things.,1
I highly suggest this Tv if you are really fun of gaming and movie..,2
the  optional 64 meg card is highly recommended for any pictures on trips.,2
"So although we may have some bright & cheery people writing reviews or we have some company reps (hey, it could happen), either way, take it from someone who is just a normal individual using the cam's at home, they work.",2
The volume would vary low to high with no way to control.,0
"I wanted a smartphone for the administrative apps and features such as spreadsheets, more advanced calendar applications, as well as the photo and sound file systems.",1
"we have a 35# dog and the instructions for installing motion sensors seem to have worked, no false alarms.",2
great tablet.,2
"If you're a gamer, this is your ticket.",2
"With the purchase of a 27"" iMac, I decided I needed to try again.",1
The solution to this would have been a Variable Audio Output on the TV that would allow you to use the TV speakers and an external audio system with one single volume controlling both.,1
Any ways I love this phone I recommend it!,2
"I just bought this model, and I also own a Sony 40"" S model.",1
"If you plan on staying dry (or sand, fog, dust, etc.",1
"However, the one downside I would mention is that it's a little too tall for using one-handed.",0
I have been using a S5 for past couple of days and have ordered a unlocked one from my local store.,1
I have been ignored by your so called customer service for far to long now.,0
"This is a dull cloudy day, and the lighting is relatively flat, but the detail is nice and sharp when enlarged to 8X10 prints.",2
"This camera also uses a ""Duo/PRO Duo Card"", a very small memory card, not the SD cards which are cheaper, easier to find, and are just as fast.All in all, I give this camera a 4.5 out of 5 stars.",2
My 5 year old 4 megapixel Canon A520 produces better indoor photos than the Panasonic ZS7.,2
"I have it directly connected to the Ethernet Port and things load much faster than they do with the wireless.Too bad the original showed up damaged but true to their word, Amazon started the refund process right away.",0
"Some are good, others not so much.",1
"After 5 months the power button stopped working, so I plan to buy the lg phone.",0
LG came through.,2
"wonderful phone, really nice and easy, well contruction also, i certanly recommend it, and the price is very good too.",2
"Wait till you see how fast OSX is etc.Then I realize without a SSD this garbage is slow, only has 4GB of ram, doesn't even come with a SSD and the screen resolution sucks.Wish I had gone with a ASUS computer I would have gotten double the RAM, super fast SSD and better overall design.",2
I have been researching it for a month.,1
"It is about $100 more than the Canon PowerShot SX500 (16.0 MP Digital Camera with 30x Wide-Angle), but worth every penny.",2
"If you're new to DSLR's, you'll love how much there is to learn with this camera.",2
The pictures are great and it has a lot of good features to help take them.,2
"For the last year I've been using a Samsung Focus, which is a very good phone with one limitation: screen size.",2
"And if you use the channel button on the remote to go to a major network channel, it takes you to the analog one, not the digital one.",1
Very good picture quality and easy to set up and get started.,2
The phone lives up to all the specifications only negative is its battery live.,2
"Could not view cameras over the network.Issue 1: Cellular Carriers require Static IP Addresses because the Cellular Broadband Network sits behind a NAT firewall, which blocks all users from displaying a public IP address.",1
"I have been using this tv without a cable box, as is intended with a smart tv.",1
This is the only camera i shoot JPGs only.,1
My brother-in-law looked at it last night.,1
"Yes this is an expensive purchase, be we feel it's not worth the hassle.- This set has a terrible side viewing angle.",0
"Really great picture, can't complain.",2
"After browsing several sites, I decided to buy the Pentax Optio W60.I have used digital cameras since 1999, including a variety of Sony and Canon compacts, and the Digital Rebel XTi.",1
This came in before its estimated time and I love the phone!,2
This one is simple to use and takes fantastic pictures.,2
"Now, I must say that I have made a right choice.",2
"For now, I'm stuck with HC and I don't even know when I can upgrade to ICS :(",0
This is a great water-proof camera that you can let kids (i.e.,2
"It will go completely dead while the phone is OFF.Overheats often, freezes up.",0
"But, the purchasing experience was ""slick as a whistle.""",2
It is the best cuz u can get it for cheap but I was a lil worried when I dout it wasn't goin 2 come n but it came like it said,2
"The Sony I replaced in my living room couldn't tune in CBS, and was super picky about NBC, and for everything else I had to constantly adjust the antenna.",0
!,
"If it sounds too good to be true, the phone you get will likely have problems.If the phone were new it would have its own flaw or two.",0
I have down loaded more apps and that I am running out of memory space.,0
The in-camera editing features are pretty cool and can add some style and effects to your pics.,2
But off craigslist for 100 bucks was good deal.I have not been through all the features but it is obvious to me that this is the latest in tv technology at a reasonable price.,2
"Controls are good, slide out keyboard clear and easy to use.",2
The onlyway to get rid of it is to turn off and turn the tv back onagain.We have a Samsung 22 inch with the same outside dimensions andit is working without a problem.Vizio Support could not fix the problems.,0
"It turns out that most Ultrabooks have regular spinning drives for mass storage, plus a small SSD for quick booting, etc.One unique feature is the ""I/O door"".",1
!,
He had to call and request a 3rd panel replacement AND new wiring harnesses to fix issues with the wiring in the set as well.,0
The user interface looks crappy but I didn't pay much for it so I don't expect a pretty UI on it.,0
Good Luck.,1
I use it mostly with my Nikon 16-85mm VR lens most of the time and I get great results.,2
"If you want customer service that knows what they are doing and tell you one policy NOT two different policies, buy a different product.",0
So its wider and with more telephoto.5.,1
Shadow detail and dark scenes are very good for a TV of this price.,2
"I'm mostly surfing the web and doing email and I'm not likely to watch movies on it, so smaller works better because it's just the right size to hold and ""thumb type"" like you would your smartphone.",2
This camera was badly worn with heavy scratches on the entire body...like someone filled their back pocket with sand then carried the camera there...for a year!,1
(video from the same source) Hope this helps,1
Just thought the instruction booklet could have been a bit clearer.,0
Picture is remarkable.,2
Not a droid 0r I phone.,1
Remote is simple and easy to use.,2
I wasn't happy with how the color washed out and seemed pasty when I wasn't directly in front of it.,0
"I am pleased with the picture on the TV, as well as the sound.",2
I must admit I thought this phone would we outdated and would not work; however I was wrong.,1
"And now when it happens, it often sorts itself out after a bit.",1
"there was a small hiccup during commercials when at full screen), Hulu Plus, Pandora, the exercise app, MLB for score updates, MTV app to watch a music video and the accuweather app (sort of clunky to find your city but an OK app).",1
So essentially you have no choice on what you want to use because the updates force you to accept software and apps without any clear cut way to get rid of it permanently.Wish I had never gotten myself stuck with this thing for 2 years.,0
Thanks for a great product!,2
I need a smoke alarm to be reliable and work correctly when needed.,1
"In our case, our Brighthouse remote DID allow linking the AUX (audio) volume to the CABLE remote functions on the Brighthouse remote, so we could use the Brighthouse remote to adjust the amplified volume while in CABLE mode, eliminating having to switch that remote to AUX mode just to adjust or mute sound.",1
The phone came on time and was brand new and for the price it was a steal.,2
I was easily able to download books and used it on a 7.5 hour flight with no problems.,2
"Wonderful item easy to install, strong heavy duty material.",2
!,
Ear bug has no problems.,1
"I was originally thinking of a Dynex or Insignia, but I heard they have terrible sound and terrible contrast ratio (like 1000:1) that's terrible.",0
"This tablet so far, satisfied my needs.",2
Now I have a slightly longer HDMI cord than what I originally had.,1
The only way to get any sound back was to turn the thing off and then on again.,1
I needed a phone both for my kids and for myself.,1
Why is the iPhone so successful?,1
Beautiful TV.,2
"EVEN ON MINIMUM sensitivity, the cameras record almost continuously and you can only go forward 16x speed.",1
I feel like a kid at Christmas!,1
:)Plusses:Netflix and Amazon Prime Streaming are great.,2
Some shades will take care of that.,1
The Playbook connects via Bluetooth to my phone and my computer.,1
"Be aware, it is mostly all plastic, like most cameras these days, and requires carefulhandling to avoid damage.Oh, one last thing.",1
"It's a calculator, flashlight, radio, alarm clock, video camera and remote control.",1
Simply you wont be using all the potential this camera has to offer.,1
"My Time Warner remote is programed so that the set, cable box and Zvox turn on and off with a push of the systems button.",1
Easy to use.,2
I just printed some of the pictures and they look way better than I anticipated from a waterproof camera - insanely inexpensive at that.,2
Purchased the 47' Panasonic to replace a 42' Vizio that developed vertical lines.Shipping was on time and free.,2
Definitely state of the art.,2
but there are much better options available so why bother !,1
Great camera to carry in your pocket on a vacation.,2
Finding a good price on a brand new in the box took awhile but finally I found this one and I am enjoying using this ipad 2 for 3 to 4 days without having to recharge it.,2
So you connect to netflix and go to raise the volume and find out that you've just turned off the tv.,1
We'll see?,1
"The response to the remote is extremely sluggish, I regularly have to press a button two or three times before the TV ""notices"" and does something.",0
IT UPLOADS SUPER QUICK TO MY LAPTOP AND I UPLOAD THEM STRAIGHT TO FACEBOOK!,2
I have recently purchased the new D90 from Nikon and can honestly say this new camera is one of the best I have ever used.,2
"You can quickly switch between taking photos of food, portraits, other macro shots, running water or fast action sports shots, they all turn out amazingly well.",2
Thank you,2
"Go with vivid, reduce all settings 10-15% except for hue, which you will want to increase into the green range (Apologies to the videofiles out there).",1
"I do not expect DSLR quality photos, but I do want photos that are consistently adequate and sometimes exceptional, no matter what the setting.",2
"Didn't realize it needed a memory card to use it but this is the first camera I've ever owned so I'm sure every other camera needs a memory card, the pictures come out great, no more pictures of my dog with red or green eyes!",2
What a joy to use!,2
Very happy with this camera in every way.,2
"To achieve greater through-put, broadcasters and/or the video content provider will increase the MPG compression, which also physical distorts the images just like JPG.",1
Meaning they aim this little toy for Low-light performance.,1
"The one thing I miss, that I had with my G series Canon point & shoot, is a preview of my shots in a tip-out LCD viewer.That being said - it's a great camera for the money.",2
Almost USELESS.,0
Now I have a 4K monitor at home and work.,1
Canon makes an excellent powershot camera.,2
"This was annoying at first, but I got a phone case (Case-mate Barely There Case for Samsung Focus S i937 - Blue [AT&T; Retail Packaging]) that helped with accidental button pushes.",1
"The cameras were a little bigger than I expected them to be, but they're not too big.",1
"I like Pentax as a brand (I am a happy owner of a Pentax K-x DSLR), so my affinity with the brand might have played a role preferring this over other similar cameras but so far I am very happy with my purchase and this equipment also passed the durability/performance test in my kids' hands.",2
"*Finally, after two days internal discussion, they agree to replace this with working refurbished one.So after 6 strikes, more than 12 hours, 6 fedex shipment between me and Dell.",1
Charge on!,2
I got this laptop yesterday.,1
"I can live with lousy sound, since I can always buy a better sound system that uses the optical audio hookup, but still...*************************OK, I forgot to mention to Toshiba that their AUTOVIEW function is also terrible.",0
Check out security camera king or nelly surplus.,1
on it.,1
Even when I don't press the menu button.It's a great phone and these problems are very minor.,2
In Amazons compare to similar led tvs they list it as a smart tv.,1
The only downside is the lack of internal memory so just buy a reasonably large micro SD card with it.,1
Sony SLR: In body image stabilization that works well (around 2 stop advantage)Olympus SLR: In body image stabilization that works well (around 4 stop advantage)No In-body image stabilization like Sony & OlympusNo Tilt & Swivel LCDNo 1080p HD video recording 60 fps,1
The bad rap this camera has received by some may stem from the ease of forgetting to pop up the manual flash to enable a faster shutter speed when shooting indoors under poor light.,0
"Otherwise, you'll be returning it like I did.",1
So as far as I can tell there units are not effected..,1
(I also recommend replacing the hand strap because it is surprisingly thin and not up to the quality of a typical hand strap.),0
"then figured it was the memory card...was about to change that too, till I came here and saw that most people had that same problem.",0
Excellent service!!,2
"I've had this phone for a few days but having previously owned an N73 and a 5800 music express, continue with good old symbian was a smooth transition.",2
This Asus Tab is a junk.,0
You will not find such device with so many attractive features anywhere in the market at lower prices.,2
I took several indoor photos and they look great.,2
"Night vision is quality, actually, the image is all around perfect.",2
"The Rebels and the 20D/30D have a ""C"" sized sensor which means that any 35mm lens you put on this body has a magnification factor of 1.6 so a 10 mm lens works a lot closer to 20 mm than ten mm etc.",1
"Face it, you want a good set, a very reliable one, and something that will last.",1
"It's just an ""OK"" tv.",1
"This is the first ""slim"" design TV that I have bought.",1
First I am not rich so let me tell you how I came out purchasing two of these tvs.,1
I check up on my second house almost daily through my iPad or iPhone.,1
I shipped the unit back to them and kept a record of the tracking number.,1
"It seems to harken back to the old Palm Pilot days.I love the fact that there is an expansion slot and yet for as nice as that is, the awkwardness in trying to delete an app or change a setting really seems to mar the overall experience.I'm 46 so it's not like I'm standing on my lawn, shaking my fist and yelling for kids to ""get off my lawn"", that being said, this product makes me scratch my head.",0
So far I have nothing negative to say about this camera.,2
"Display light didn't work, kept shutting down, got over heated and looked like it was return at least 20 times.",0
"worst thing ever, i drop it with a case on it and cracked the screen in a week.",0
I don't spend time to review all of the items that I purchased from Amazon.,1
It really helped me in this instance!,2
Would do it again if I need another one.,2
I bought it for one of my bedrooms and I only by Samsung for my house but decided that I didn't want to pay Samsung price for bedroom.,1
Love the panorama shot I took with it and this camera has a great zoom and overall quality.I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good quality camera,2
The software download was flawless (vista; I also have it streaming to my blackberry...way too cool.,2
Its a great camera to take with you while travelling when you don't want to bring your expensive camera with you.The manual functions in the camera is not so great.,1
I bought these phones for my wife and I to use with Straight Talk.,1
"(right side)Score- 8/10Interface/stability-This runs on android 4.0, but it can be upgraded and I believe mine is running on 4.1 or something along the lines.The one thing I wasn't crazy about was how big the icons are.",1
"Not that mine was cheap, it cost approx.",1
"Not a huge problem - I learned to just click->right through menus, as it acts like an ""enter"" press.- Noise is pretty good, but don't expect miracles -- You need good exposure for high ISO.",1
Watching from an angle didn't affect the quality either which was a concern with some of the tvs I looked at.I agonized over this choice for a while but in the end I couldn't be happier.,2
"I have been tired lugging around large cameras and extra lenses, so that when you reach the age of 70,  this camera will suffice for anyone.",1
"Your settings may vary depending on source, room conditions, and personal preference.",1
"I backed off the brightness a tad from the cinema setting, and with just that little bit of adjustment it produces a very nice picture.",2
"It took me a couple of weeks to get used to it - in fact, it was a week before I took it for a walk outside the house :) It's just a few ounces in weight and it feels very delicate - like it might break or drop.",0
Also the file size for videos in high resolution is too large to e-mail.,0
My surprise was that after 4 hours the phone was dead.,0
"We look forward to seeing you again soon Best regards, Anil K.  ""Nothing but apologies and in-action from 7/17/13 to 9/1/13.FOR A REGISTRATION PROBLEM!""",0
"* Nice to have: GPS, WIFI, CLS commander mode for the built-in flash, Stereo external Mic jack with Audio Level meter, Waterproof (and sell it for $249!",1
This is the second time I've bought this exact camera.,1
I also like that the touch screen keyboard has good sized buttons.,2
"Most reviewers have already said it, but this phone is fine for the price.",2
"More like a 1"" beam.",1
"They e-mailed me back in less than 24 hours, and said to please call them, and they would forward my call to the technical person I needed to talk to about the matter.",1
"Coming from a point and shoot world, I wanted something I could keep close without a huge bag but that could take better pictures.So far, I've mostly been using point and shoot mode.",1
I purchased this camera a few months ago.,1
Apparently some part of the power supply quit.,1
we've had this tv for a month now.,1
"I used this camera to take over 1,500 photos on a recent trip to China and it performed beautifully.",2
This unit has a much better picture.,2
"But here are the down sides, its a plasma so it does get some image pretension but its not bad and fades quickly.",2
But network content getting our signals over the air is pretty much full screen and immaculate.,2
"They are a little high (Maybe 3""), but I have them on the ceiling and they do not bother me.",1
It is most noticed when watching in a dimly lit room (i.e.,1
"Shipping is free, and the UPS guy will bring this TV right into your house and set it in your foyer, or which ever room is by your front door.",2
"I am not expert in taking pictures but things like fast focus, simple menu, light exposure are important for me.",1
"Also, the screen is very unresponsive.",0
"However, as time goes on it is becoming worse.",0
There is an app on Android that works very well to control all features from your smart phone or tablet.The alarms could use some work.,1
"I have loved the Blackberry since my very first one, the BB Pearl.",2
"For $550-$650 you get an attractive 50"" LED with fantastic picture quality.",2
This 16MP Panasonic Lumix produces low-quality photos on a par with a Kodak I had nearly 10 years ago.,0
